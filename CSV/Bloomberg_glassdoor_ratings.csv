No learning/fail-fast mindset, get ready to be yelled at and called a 'f*#$ing idiot' if something in your area is going in the wrong direction and for your manager to take credit when things are going well. No diversity at the top, probably due to the lack of flexibility. People not treated like human beings (e.g. team that doesn't say hi or bye, useless meeting culture where meetings mean you're always busy a.k.a. important). Incentives do not drive collaboration or supportive teams - very siloed and hard to move things forward.

This job is dressed to try and compete with those sorts of jobs but is ultimately just a customer service help desk with very little else to offer (outside of going to sales).

- management is made up of people who have been consistently mediocre and reached their position by simply sticking around
- top talent is treated poorly and overworked compared to the average
- micromanaged to the nth degree
- every aspect of the job is measured statistically - management has so much as said that the system is designed for someone to be unable to excel in all aspects of the role. As such compensation is determined by how much your manager likes you instead of your productivity and ability
- popularity contest where you are forced to ""play the game"" with mostly mediocre managers in order to get ahead",pay your top talent what they deserve and recognize that you have a consistent (over the course of years) issue with retaining them.

- Awesome resume builder (don’t stay at Bloomberg for more than 3 years)","- Middle management consists of a bunch of people who were too crappy to get a job somewhere else, but Bloomberg never fires anyone so you’re stuck with a bunch of lame managers
- Management does not recognize talent from the individual contributor level in the analytics and sales departments
- they try to get you with the “golden handcuffs” will give you up to $100-$120k and that is the glass ceiling. After a few promotions. Don’t get sucked into it. You can make A LOT more money elsewhere after your experience at Bloomberg.",#NAME?,4,0,0,0,0,0
