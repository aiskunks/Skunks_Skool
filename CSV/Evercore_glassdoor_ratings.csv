They have nice perks like a cafe, opportunity for a bonus, and holiday parties and gifts. Health benefits are great, average vacation and holiday package.","Depending on who you work for being an EA actually means being a personal assistant and doing personal favors, returning library books, buying things on ebay for someones family, researching flower arrangements, etc, in addition to all the meeting scheduling, travel, and heavy calendaring. A lot of EA's in my department work heavy overtime due to this. Consider learning to exercise good boundaries because you might be pushed beyond reasonable limits.

Evercore is one of the top banks in the industry and growing at an incredible pace. Working here is a privilege and most importantly, a door to opportunity in further building my career. People are approachable, even at the very top, if you are willing to be confident, outgoing, and professional. The top executives recognize talent and WILL notice you if you know your stuff inside and out. I work very closely with top partners at the firm and I can’t say enough wonderful things about them- and these are people who have enormous accomplishments with world recognition. The company makes a genuine effort to enforce a sense of community regardless of your level. If you believe in the saying that working hard will eventually get you somewhere, then work here. If you study and work the long hours, you will move up. That’s how life works and Evercore strongly values commitment and loyalty to excelling in your craft. This company has strong values and it shows in their talent. Great benefits, solid salary, and wonderful growth opportunities. I look forward to building my career with them.","Long work hours, work becomes life but you still love it. This firm values devotion to excellence- the executives come from intense backgrounds and lots of success. If you don’t put work first, you won’t survive. This isn’t necessarily a con, but it does mean sacrificing a large part of your personal life for long hours. It will pay off immensely though.",Keep going and love your company culture.
