Fannie Mae,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Fannie-Mae-Reviews-E247.htm,2/23/2019,,,Current Employee ,Many opportunities for career moves. Management could use additional training.,More than 5 years,0,It is a large company with many opportunities for lateral career moves and upward mobility. The compensation and benefits are generally meet industry average.,"Job titles and pay grades are confusing and sometimes inappropriate based on the role. Varying levels of experience amongst managers with different standards of performance expectations (some are harsher or more perfectionistic while some are more lenient or more realistic) and sometimes unclear, shared, or split responsibility for employees which is a common management mistake. Work/life balance varies across different teams as some teams offer less flexibility than others. Visible difference between treatment of FTEs and contractors. Common theme amongst numerous contractors that they wouldn't want to work at the company full-time.","Management needs further training on how to effectively evaluate performance, coach and develop employees. Perfectionistic managers may stunt career growth and development of employees and inaccurately assess consistency of performance based on proven track record of delivering upon goals. These types of managers do very little to support the professional growth and development of employees and do not have supportive relationships with their directs but rather treat their professional relationships as business transactions instead of a human connection. At the relationship level, harsher managers may sometimes do more damage than good in order to meet overly aggressive business goals.

More lenient managers tend to have better relationships and tend to be more realistic about an employee's strengths and weaknesses and are better at identifying a good fit for their skillset. At the same time, these types of managers may not enforce the same high standard for performance expectations.

Management should work to strike a balance for this.",4,4,4,5,4,3
