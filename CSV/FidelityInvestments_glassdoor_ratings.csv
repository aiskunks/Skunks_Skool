The breadth of this company provides a great opportunity to try out different career paths or boost your current one.,"In my current role, I am working overtime more often than I'd like with recognition that seems to only go so far until it sizzles out. That may be tied to the size of the company itself, where promotions work in a ""trickle down"" manner.",No advice. I like the direction Abby is taking this company. I think sticking to our current principles will turn out to be a big success.,5,4,5,4,5,5

The best, most extensive, and most customized benefits of any company I've ever worked for.
Well expressed values.
There is a lot of chance to try new things, moving up, sideways, or diagonally while still remaining at the same company.
Leaving each day feeling that I actually had a down-steam impact on helping someone increase their financial wellness.","Pay tends to be lower than equivalent roles at other firms, but when you factor in the tax-advantages of the benefits offered, you often come out ahead of what a competing firm would pay.
There is a LOT of hierarchy here, So many departments and divisions that it is easy to loose touch with all that the company does.
It takes a couple years to get used to the internal Jargon - everything has an acronym!",Keep up the fantastic work Abby. Thank you so much to you and your family for providing us such a great place to work!,5,3,5,5,5,4

The company always emphasizes creating financial plans that puts clients in a better situation according to generally accepted principles of financial planning.","It’s best to join the company young and completely buy in to Fidelity’s view of how financial plans should be drawn up. Those with a tremendous amount of external experience may struggle vs those who completely drink the Fidelity Kool Aid. There is almost no flexibility or creativity among Financial Consultants. If Fidelity we’re managing their business 100% according to plan, it would not matter at all which FC you worked with because every single one of them would offer you precisely the same solutions.",There is very little to improve on. Fidelity is an amazingly well run organization. I believe the constraints on FC creativity are a necessary evil caused by the sheer heft of 6 or 7 trillion dollars of assets under administration and their business model.,4,4,5,4,4,5

- flexible work schedule (depending on your team, you could have the opportunity to work from home)
- lots of training opportunities
- a culture that encourages career growth and movement
- no dress code, definitely a relaxed company that's focused on what matters: the customers and the services","- some benefits take up to a year to kick in
- base pay could be more competitive
- leadership expects folks at the team level to be agile, but they don't drive agility amongst themselves
- there's little communication among upper management to each other on what their teams are working on to prevent duplication of efforts... you could probably find 3 or 4 tools across the BUs that do the same exact thing","Make sure that you're taking steps to be agile, too. People cannot be ""agile"" and have strict deadlines at the same time. All that leads to is cutting corners and bad quality software. Setting goals are completely fine, but be flexible and make sure not EVERYTHING is a high priority... weigh initiatives against each other, then decide what pieces are high priority versus medium versus low.

Networking: As mentioned above, networking is necessary to move up here. It doesn't come naturally to me, so I put it in the cons. It does require extra time and thought, and the company won't pay you to shadow other positions.",,4,5,4,5,5,4

Profit sharing, PTO is given at the beginning of the year, the people work with, training program was good when I went through it, they help pay back your student loans.",It’s a typical call center with hours all over the place. They will tell you there is no “mandatory” overtime but there is and if you opt out of it you will get nasty messages. Bonuses are based off of call surveys which sometimes you will get a bad survey that wasn’t even from a call you took and there’s nothing you can do about it. Even if you move to another product you will still be overloaded with 401k calls. If you have to go to the bathroom and it’s not during a break or lunch it counts against you. If you don’t plan your days off at least a month in advanced it counts against you. There are more things that count against you then for you. The environment has gotten really bad lately and you can feel it when you walk in the door. Fidelity throws benefits at you but then doesn’t bother to check in on the call center. Turnover rate is really high.,Take a look at your call center. Offering a raffle in exchange for overtime hours mean nothing. Passing out a $1 snack item for working a 12 hour day means nothing. Look at other companies around you and see what they do to help out the environment. You will continue to have a high turnover rate until you improve your call center. There are a lot of employees who have been there for a long time that with the new way of doing things are ready to leave. You are going to loose a lot of good people.,2,1,3,2,3,4

You can't ask for much in the way of consideration for health issues, you either fit their mold or you are considered a problem and they find a way to dismiss you.",Open seating is a waste of your time and an anxiety for most people.
