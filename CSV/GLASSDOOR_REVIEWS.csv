Management could use additional training.,More than 5 years,0,It is a large company with many opportunities for lateral career moves and upward mobility. The compensation and benefits are generally meet industry average.,"Job titles and pay grades are confusing and sometimes inappropriate based on the role. Varying levels of experience amongst managers with different standards of performance expectations (some are harsher or more perfectionistic while some are more lenient or more realistic) and sometimes unclear, shared, or split responsibility for employees which is a common management mistake. Work/life balance varies across different teams as some teams offer less flexibility than others. Visible difference between treatment of FTEs and contractors. Common theme amongst numerous contractors that they wouldn't want to work at the company full-time.","Management needs further training on how to effectively evaluate performance, coach and develop employees. Perfectionistic managers may stunt career growth and development of employees and inaccurately assess consistency of performance based on proven track record of delivering upon goals. These types of managers do very little to support the professional growth and development of employees and do not have supportive relationships with their directs but rather treat their professional relationships as business transactions instead of a human connection. At the relationship level, harsher managers may sometimes do more damage than good in order to meet overly aggressive business goals.

More lenient managers tend to have better relationships and tend to be more realistic about an employee's strengths and weaknesses and are better at identifying a good fit for their skillset. At the same time, these types of managers may not enforce the same high standard for performance expectations.

Management should work to strike a balance for this."

One bad deal team can destroy your year-end review, whether or not you were the actual problem.","Follow through on your accountability in the review process. If there is a mid-level or senior banker with consistently negative reviews, and junior bankers see no progress, they will leave (either to another bank or a buyside job).

Good pay (but you have to prove you deserve it - they will verify pay from previous employers). Pizza Friday's in a small kitchen.,"Cliquey staff and middle management blocks advancement. If they don't move up then you don't move up even if you deserve it. Bankers and execs don't mingle with the support staff they just stay in their wooden and glass offices. Admins think they run the show and are constantly fighting amongst themselves. They are supervised by a higher admin who they walk all over. Operations teams couldn't get it together if their life depended on it. Place looks and feels outdated in front and back of house. Wood throughout entire entrance space looks like an old school 80s law firm. Back areas looks like an insane alyssum/off white color only dingier. The IT systems are a joke and our inboxes were always hit with spam followed by ""Do not open those emails"" notices once or twice a week. It's an embarrassment that a company that wealthy can't get simple infrastructure issues addressed once and for all. the HR is like every other company that is run by sorority sisters. No work life balance for staff, not family friendly and when one banker jumped out a window, it was only a brief mention by the top brass. Nothing changed the culture and people are still expected to work like dogs through all hours of the night. Don't expect company picnics or company activities with the exception of a company Christmas party that is always stale since nobody mingles outside of their pay grade circle. Not friendly. No one even mingles at pizza friday they grab their food and go.",Culture needs to be changed. Appreciate your staff. Pay them what they deserve and treat them right and you wouldn't lose good talent or have them jump out of windows. I left after that since it was a wake up call to staff. Stop the beauracacy. You can't act big business but be cheap like a start up. And throw some paint on the walls. A little color would raise spirits. Offer middle management addition training on how to be better managers. Most of them were only promoted due to length of years in service. The saying goes they corporations lose talent not because of the job but because of their managers.

The firm minus those individuals (mid-level and senior especially in media, healthcare and some others which maybe I'll hint at another time) as well as some terribly pathetic associates make what could be a decent experience, horrible. It's why the only reason (and i stress 'only' very seriously) junior folks (including associates, yes you read right) join solely so they can get a brand name on their resume and recruit right away. Many many associates and VPs are currently recruiting at funds and other banks. And if comp ever lost its premium over other places, Moelis would lose all its top talent to other places as well as hiring power for future years.",Seriously think about your people - not just juniors but also the seniors who can very easily leave if they realize whats happening at junior levels. This is a culture where people openly hate working here and it isn't one or two people complaining - it's a generally accepted thing across a whole gamut of people as well as past classes. There's a small group of people at the VP / MD level who are just grueling to work for and ruin it for everyone. They've survived one very bad incident in 2015...another one and no amount of PR will be able to cover up problems with working here. The wellness seminars and nicely worded emails won't change the fact that some VPs and MDs behave terribly and create work and un-required timelines that eventually push people off the edge.

Their sales tactics are overly pushy and questionable, and the people who run the company are all bros that peaked in college (more on this to come).

During my time here, I had multiple “leaders” and I was instructed to mislead clients into options that had no benefit. You sell on their ignorance. If a client doesn’t realize they’re losing money over 30 years, you sell it. You’ll be told to sell the worst loans so your leaders can win competitions.

You’re not allowed to leave your desk - sometimes they bring in breakfast, lunch AND dinner so you stay at your desk and on the phones all day. Recently i was off the phone for 30 minutes and the regional director asked where i was - i was eating lunch and once i was done my team had a meeting on why it’s not acceptable to leave the phones that long.

“Leaders” will insult you - they say they’re just playing but we all know how it is. You’ll be sworn at and called names and expect you to “laugh it off.”

The compensation plans and the company in general are very misleading - if you’re not hitting their unrealistic goals, expect to make enough for the month to barely get by if you have low expenses. I would recommend anyone who is looking into this company to think twice before accepting a position. I was bought in by the “fun work environment” and “culture.”

They promote this idea that it's a fun work environment - again, that’s how i was sold. The office theme is much like The Great Gatsby, with the bright colors throughout and fancy decor. There’s a ping pong table, pool table, popcorn machines, slushy machines, free snacks (which get old after a month), Golden Tee, tricycles, etc.. You can enjoy those either during training your first month or lunch (again, god forbid you take more than 20 minutes out of a 10+ hour day to eat lunch).

They push you and push you until there isn't a single ounce of energy left in you. They brainwash you into thinking that working 70+ hour work weeks is the norm, where if you work a 60 hour week you don’t want to succeed and have no drive. They select favorites and who gets better lead flow, and you’re given recycled leads that top mortgage bankers failed to sell (for obvious reasons: low credit score, no income, bankruptcy, etc. aka you’re wasting the clients time with false hope).

This job is the definition of Modern Day Slavery. If you drink the kool-aid and become brainwashed to thinking this is normal and a great company to work for, have at it. They act like they own you and shame you for wanting to have a work/life balance.",

C0000173,R00553,4/16/2019, Mortgage Banker,"Detroit, MI",Current Employee ,Opportunity comes at a cost,More than a year,0,"If you are willing to trade in your time for the opportunity to build an amazing career, this is a great place. It's a fast-paced sales job, and you need to be willing to work 7:30-9:00pm, most days, 5-6 days a week, most weeks, period. Do that, and follow the amazing coaching and leadership to a tee, and you'll succeed. Try to go your own way, or to do anything short of close, close close the sale... you'll struggle. Your pay is based on exceeding goal, and goal is meant to be met by half the region or so. Hit goal and you'll see $2800/mo hourly plus about $4000 commission.

You can absolutely find success. The team gives you every single opportunity to be financially set, however as a banker, it is accepted that you will not have a life outside of work, period. After 4 years of extremely high success and hours, you may become a level 5 President's Club banker, who can sometimes work from home but will enjoy $20,000 in commissions each month for the same volume that earns intro bankers $4,000-10,000. That's the tradeoff: time for payscale and some flexibility.","Miss goal, even by one or two, and you'll be looking at $2800 hourly and around $1000 commission. For 70 hours a week (yes, 70, no matter what your tiering is), you better be pushing yourself to earn the business. Not to mention, clients drop out of process, no big deal. Just be sure you write enough business to make up for the hit.

You will be free most days from 8-10pm, and maybe one day a weekend. You are expected to come into the office on weekends, and encouraged to come both days. Goal is meant to be hit, and you are meant to come in 27 out of 30 days a month, believe it.","Get rid of ACE compensation; it's discouraging your bankers and encouraging seasoned talent to look elsewhere. We desperately need to make compensation competitive again because we all know it isn't. Our bankers are getting snatched up left and right by less proficient companies, and that is because of a mindset of ""marketshare > our people"". I love this company and our culture, however the way bankers view their worth is often in a way that will surely have a negative and lasting impact on our culture."

Communication between leaders and senior leadership poor.
Leadership and Sr Leadership has poor understanding of new roles with SAFe methodology.
Leaders don't hold team members with difficulty with time management and no self organization accountable.
Leader and team member on boarding is non existent for new and returning members.
Too green of leaders not held accountable.
Have programs for leadership that are corky and unrealistic to everyday leadership.
With the SAFe model, leadership doesn't understand their additional responsibility.
Working with legal stakeholders is difficult.
Legal team members are bullish, demanding and blow up scope.
Legal team members believe everything is a ""hair on fire"" situation and ""want it done yesterday"" even if they just mentioned it.
Leadership programs make it seem like their leaders believe in the culture, but in reality life that's not how it works.","Improve your communication.
Teach your new leaders, just because there are leadership programs doesn't mean they know how to lead.
Push back on legal stakeholders to really define their priority as everything cannot be done yesterday when they tell us the same day.
This leads to a very high anxiety, high strung, and tense relationship with them. You have allowed a legal team member to bully technology team members into doing their bidding. Team members are afraid to speak up and defend themselves against that and poor leaders. Leadership does not get rid of poor quality team members, it is almost as if they protect them. Which doesn't make sense because they are a waste of time, money, and sufficate the potential for hard working highly skilled team members to be hired.
Since Dan and Bill have not been directly overseeing the company anymore I'm afraid there has been a continued downward trend of the culture. After seven years the technology with compliance side has almost completely lost the culture except for a few leaders. Over the last three years I have seen more team members jump ship to get out of legal compliance area either warm transfer or getting jobs outside of QL. The area is toxic, the leadership is poor (albiet a fee leaders). There's no true sense of directional leadership except the bullying from legal business team members (really one specifically). I really enjoyed working for QL over the last seven years and only hope for the best that they can recover on the legal technology side the culture that has made QL who it is today."

People are often held accountable for things they knew nothing about and when the fires come burning down, everyone is standing around confused and somehow, it's your fault, then ding there goes your bonus or raise. Pay is extraordinarily low.","Stop scheduling so many meetings for leadership to pontificate for hours on action items that could've been an e-mail. Create a culture where team leaders are able to develop better working relationships with their team by actually spending time with them and not drive by one on ones that aren't valuable. Hire more minorities and if you choose not to, stop boasting about diversity and inclusion just because there's a diversity and inclusion team - there's literally no diversity. Hold your directors more accountable for the team as they set the tone. If there's an absentee director, don't you think that's also a reflection of how the team operates?

When you're handling $15,000 in diamond jewelry, or have all the cash the store took in the prior day on your desk, you can't just get up and walk away from it to get a customer a glass of water just because one of the sales team is freaking out over it. As ridiculous as this sounds, management can, and has, reprimanded operations team members for not doing exactly this.

There are also a lot of cynical efforts made to use Operations people as salespeople, in part because our commission rate is lower (but the hourly *is* higher).

HR seems to protect managers who act inappropriately. Countless claims were made in good faith against a store director who acted inappropriately around women and made crucial decisions based (at least in part) on race. It wasn't even a secret that any of this was happening, but no remedial action was taken. Because of this, the store suffered a turnover rate close to 100%.

No career growth opportunities, with promotions seemingly based on favoritism or nepotism.

Operational expenses are poorly decided upon, like continuing to purchase 15 bottles of silver polish per month, despite only using 1 bottle per month, which leads to spoilage and, ultimately, waste. The company also decided to opt for more expensive hand soap for the bathrooms while simultaneously planning layoffs.

Ancient computer systems - younger employees think they're being Punk'd when they're presented with AS/400.

Oh, and Google the time they conspired to fire an African-American store manager over race.","I seriously have no advice that this company's ""leadership"" would follow. Nobody wants this product or experience anymore, and you don't treat your employees fairly. I'd say the writing's on the wall."

Brand recognition, beautiful product, low stress/ pressure unless you count low commission checks.","If you have been here more than 6 years you should have a pretty full book of clients that are repeat purchasers. However, less than 3 years, and you will struggle to hit your sales goal 6 out of 12 months. It's truly luck of the draw on customers. It's an up system at a lot of stores and you can wait over an hour between clients - it's that slow. No one is coming in to buy.
Example: My up turn I may get the person dropping off a cleaning or someone who has never been in Tiffany and just wants to take pictures. The next sales person gets the serious client who drops $10,000-$50,000. It's a lot of luck.
No more goal adjustment on vacation or sick days.
No more individual bonus if you're doing well; it's now a team bonus based on the stores results.
Language skill employees not only earn more per hour, they also get half of your sell if they assist in translation. That's if they decide to help you or if they don't snake the sell for themselves.
1% commission payout.
 If you're lucky to get in to management - you make a nice salary to sit in your office checking facebook, booking yoga classes, and not actually having to develop your team.","Rethink how many stores you truly need for a luxury brand.
We need mens jewelry and cologne! Our current offering is sad.
Management should earn a base plus commission. If they have to rely on their stores performance for pay, they will be more engaged and drive sales instead of sitting in an office, posting meme's and collecting a steady check.
Make sure your management team has sales experience.
Instead of cutting pay, cut expenses. Change your transfer policy for jewelry; this will save a ton in overnight shipping and high value insurance coverage. The amount of plastic bags and tissue paper we go through is insane. Our ""customers"" use us for free fancy water without buying a thing. We don't recycle."

1. If you are an Underwriter, expect to be doing data entry, you clear and register new business yourself, you have to fill out a 200+ data points in an excel spreadsheet for rating and then expect to get 4-5 emails from rating to clarify before getting it back. Rating is in India so there is a language and comprehension barrier but upper management doesn’t care. It takes about 4 hours to clear one piece of new business and fingers crossed the system doesn’t error out, if you report errors to the ASC expect to hear it’s all good because you eventually got it to clear.
2. Live and die by the underwriting model.
3. Expect to spend 50% of your time in meetings.
4. Expect to be a yes person without the ability to provide solutions.
5. Expect a ridiculous micromanaged environment with a last minute fire drill almost every day so management knows where performance is at (a problem that could be solved with better systems).
6. Systems do not work so expect to spend 50% of your time on items that should be automated and that are data entry.
7. The appetite is being dramatically narrowed, to the point where Middle Markets is only focused on certain areas and best of class business. Well that is what everyone wants, you have to take the good with the bad!
8. Retention is down considerably and no one is writing new business. There are senior Underwriters who haven’t written new business.
9. Brokers don’t trust Zurich and are not placing new business with them.
10. There is an extreme lack of accountability with the underwriting assistants, their goals are different from underwriting so they don’t care about writing new business and what’s important.

C0000157,R00773,8/29/2017, Vice President,"Schaumburg, IL",Former Employee ,Vice President,More than 10 years,0,Large company environment .,Where to begin. Tough to survive in this mix-master unless you are a real suck-up to management. Does not value diversity of opinion. The Swiss are a real piece of work. Not really all that smart but forceful in their presentation. It's so large that I think there is little management can do to damage or improve the firm. Culture in Schaumburg is horrible. Lot's of turn-over of senior management. Lack of direction - who do they want to be today? Lot's of people heading to meetings or looking for something to do. Pretty negative folks who really don't like change. It's feels a bit like a government job.,Management doesn't stick around long enough to have an impact - pointless to provide advice as they will have moved on before any real impact.

Managers only give lip service to employee engagement and performance trumps strategy. Hit the numbers or hit the road mentality. Your IDP is given lip service with no help by managers to get to you to your career goal. Stagnant company that is not positioned to move forward and be profitable. HR is not your friend. IT is way behind the times. Company says they are competitive, but proof is in the numbers 3 to 5 years from now. High performers are not recognized or rewarded.","Be honest with your employees. If you sell to the customer and market that Zurich values employee engagement then live what you sell and truly value your employees. Cronyism has to end or the Peter Principle will continue to harm this once great company under the leadership of Jim Schiro. Promote high performers in the company, not ""yes"" men/women. Reward feedback and stop punishing dissent or other ideas. The strategy of shrinking to be profitable will hurt in the long run as your competition will gobble up your once loyal customers. Show loyalty to long-term productive employees and stop pushing them out of the door and replacing them with inexperienced but way cheaper persons."

This approach is OK when all is well but when things go wrong -- they double down on their faulty thinking (because they cant be wrong). This eventually leads to wholesale management changes, instability and a miserable experience for all involved (employees and customers).","Hire experts, hire leaders -- NOT ""yes-men"".

RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.,"Listen to your employees. Get rid of middle and top management that know nothing about the industry or the actual duties being performed. They make rules and procedures that are completely nonsense and do not apply to this type of work, such as lien manufacturing, and cross selling insurance products. Auditors are auditors and every insured is unique. Management does not realize this after how many years in business. They expect a 15 hour audit to take 3 hours...according to their algorithm (obviously produced by a non-auditor). They do NOT care about their employees, instead they are condescending and deliberately malicious, lying to downgrade you at every review. There is no respect for employees otherwise they would listen to them and run the business based on reality, not college textbook methods and overzealous methodology that does not work for the underwriting and auditing departments.

Since the North American Executive team drove the US business off the cliff, the boys club will do anything to justify their existence driving unfair hiring practices from the oustide and from within the organization. While the Schaumburg team sits in their brand new shiny office space - while other employees are sitting on top of each other or don't even have a place to sit because of overcrowding because of consolidated office spaces to save $.","Need a new leadership team and a new message to inspire and lead the company again. A leadership team with experience in leading companies - not consulting contracts. It can't include the US CEO bragging about his personal shopper at Nordstrom's, or his new shiny Mercedes experience - completely disconnected from what's happening around him. It can't include the US CFO bragging about a new house with a membership to a golf club and feeling sad her kids will miss their old personal swimming pool. The damage has been done, but the US Executimes pretend they did not and do not continue to make bad decisions around the wrong models they forced UWs to use or the fact the culture became so internally focused, that so many high level leaders left market facing activities to a sales team."
