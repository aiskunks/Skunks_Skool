I've personally lost data and the IT team has been unable to get it back, literally losing 100s of hours of work.

IT management constantly changes direction, they don't bother to ask the business what the community wants, instead they run with their own agenda, separate to business requirements.

Our IT team is so far behind our competitors, it's not even funny, Windows 7 and Office 2010, ridiculous!

Constantly work 100 hour + weeks, not appreciated by management, no room for advancement, no work life balance.","Pay attention to your lower-level managers, they're doing more damage than you know.",1,1,2,1,4,1

On most teams, it is a meritocracy - if you prove you are intelligent and have the ability to handle the work, teams are more than willing to allow you to run with a project.","The IB experience at Moelis is very binary, depending on which teams you end up working with. There are certain teams who care very little about your work/life balance, professional development, or general happiness. They are in the minority, but there are far too many left after 5+ of junior bankers raising the issues to Management - they should have been weeded out long ago. One bad deal team can destroy your year-end review, whether or not you were the actual problem.","Follow through on your accountability in the review process. If there is a mid-level or senior banker with consistently negative reviews, and junior bankers see no progress, they will leave (either to another bank or a buyside job). That's one of the main reasons analysts / associates start thinking about leaving - they don't want a long-term career working around people who care little about them professionally (or personally).",4,2,4,5,4,2

Lots of room to step up and take responsibility.Significant opportunity to interact with senior bankers,Formal training is limited compared to big banks. Also fewer support roles require the deal team to do more (a positive and a negative - see more of the overall deal but also need to cover multiple functional areas). Brutal lifestyle but firm is aware of this and working to improve.,Keep it up. Moelis is a great platform for launching ones career.

Good pay (but you have to prove you deserve it - they will verify pay from previous employers). Pizza Friday's in a small kitchen.,"Cliquey staff and middle management blocks advancement. If they don't move up then you don't move up even if you deserve it. Bankers and execs don't mingle with the support staff they just stay in their wooden and glass offices. Admins think they run the show and are constantly fighting amongst themselves. They are supervised by a higher admin who they walk all over. Operations teams couldn't get it together if their life depended on it. Place looks and feels outdated in front and back of house. Wood throughout entire entrance space looks like an old school 80s law firm. Back areas looks like an insane alyssum/off white color only dingier. The IT systems are a joke and our inboxes were always hit with spam followed by ""Do not open those emails"" notices once or twice a week. It's an embarrassment that a company that wealthy can't get simple infrastructure issues addressed once and for all. the HR is like every other company that is run by sorority sisters. No work life balance for staff, not family friendly and when one banker jumped out a window, it was only a brief mention by the top brass. Nothing changed the culture and people are still expected to work like dogs through all hours of the night. Don't expect company picnics or company activities with the exception of a company Christmas party that is always stale since nobody mingles outside of their pay grade circle. Not friendly. No one even mingles at pizza friday they grab their food and go.",Culture needs to be changed. Appreciate your staff. Pay them what they deserve and treat them right and you wouldn't lose good talent or have them jump out of windows. I left after that since it was a wake up call to staff. Stop the beauracacy. You can't act big business but be cheap like a start up. And throw some paint on the walls. A little color would raise spirits. Offer middle management addition training on how to be better managers. Most of them were only promoted due to length of years in service. The saying goes they corporations lose talent not because of the job but because of their managers.,2,2,1,1,3,1

Savvy senior members who are hungry. Positive macro trend with more business shifting to boutiques if the firm can retain people once lockups expire.","A select handful of VPs and MDs at Moelis just ruin it for everyone. The firm minus those individuals (mid-level and senior especially in media, healthcare and some others which maybe I'll hint at another time) as well as some terribly pathetic associates make what could be a decent experience, horrible. It's why the only reason (and i stress 'only' very seriously) junior folks (including associates, yes you read right) join solely so they can get a brand name on their resume and recruit right away. Many many associates and VPs are currently recruiting at funds and other banks. And if comp ever lost its premium over other places, Moelis would lose all its top talent to other places as well as hiring power for future years.",Seriously think about your people - not just juniors but also the seniors who can very easily leave if they realize whats happening at junior levels. This is a culture where people openly hate working here and it isn't one or two people complaining - it's a generally accepted thing across a whole gamut of people as well as past classes. There's a small group of people at the VP / MD level who are just grueling to work for and ruin it for everyone. They've survived one very bad incident in 2015...another one and no amount of PR will be able to cover up problems with working here. The wellness seminars and nicely worded emails won't change the fact that some VPs and MDs behave terribly and create work and un-required timelines that eventually push people off the edge. Why do you think we probably have the hardest time on Wall Street in hiring women associates at the firm (and some of the ones we do take...let's not even go there). People matter...you will need to take this seriously otherwise this place won't last too long.,3,1,1,4,4,2

No shortage of modeling experience.,"Hours were brutal. Get caught with the wrong team and you will consistently work until 2-3 every day for weeks at a time. May be better now as they have since hired lots of additional analysts.

Lots of pitching - few of the senior bankers are any good at using analyst / associate resources efficiently... Problem with there being many analysts now means that you are less likely to get exposure to good deals as there are not always lots to go around.",,2,1,2,4,5,3
