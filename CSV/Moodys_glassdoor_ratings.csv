Communication from superiors is very fragmented and it seems the position is either getting left behind or replaced. You will pigeon-hole yourself if you take a role as an FDA. Skills are not very transferable and management is not very motivating. Superiors do not have the highest level of educational background either.

The company used to have the people you actually work with have more say in your advancement, but recently, the company introduced middle managers who don't see/understand your work as much, but have a large say in your advancement, so sucking up matters way more than performance.
Also, due to poor management of handling regulatory compliance, there are teams of people who exist to try and catch you not checking the right box so you can get your bonus taken away. It never happened to me, but it did to people I know and living in fear of the compliance cops isn't fun. Also, lots of lifers work here, so get used to unintentional caps lock and constant whining about how they don't understand the electric typing box.","The middle managers are pointless, compliance checkers create a culture of fear, you spend way too much on rent when you should have people work at home more like your competitors do (cough, s&p), and you're not that progressive so please top telling us that you are when the composition of your c suite and board looks like any other old fortune 500.

Politics at play, nobody was told why people were being “let go”, toxic individuals — extremely bad environment that made good people leave. I’ve heard things didn’t exactly get better after.","For such a well-branded global firm, key parts of HR were embarrassingly poorly run in terms of basic management and treatment of employees . I was shocked and saddened at the negative culture. I hope lessons have been learned the past few years, and the necessary improvements made. The HR work culture needs to be improved.
