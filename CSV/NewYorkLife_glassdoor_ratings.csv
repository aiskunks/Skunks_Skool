Good permanent insurance. Good for estate planning and long term care. Good for politicians.,Management is non existent. You get a one hour commercial every week and little else. The support people at the New York City general office are some of the laziest people I have ever met. Anything more complicated than a delivery receipt takes them a month to get right. They will have you running in circles unless you know every requirement and step of the process ahead of time and hound them daily until they do what you need them to.

You may think you have a flexible schedule and for the most part that is true. However, I went through a huge life event of losing my dad, and I was being called to come into the office the following week. Which if you don't work you don't get paid and neither does your partner/manager.

You are treated as a number or means to an end. And there is too much product pushing instead of doing what's right by the client.",Treat employees with empathy especially when something big is going on in their personal life.

Being a mutual, it's also devoted to the well-being of its policy holders instead of shareholders.","Once you're in, it's very hard to get promoted. The company suggests that the best way to climb the ladder is to move across departments - the idea is that high level executives are well-rounded and better able to make holistic decisions. The reality, however, is that people get placed in roles they don't have the background, skills, or education to fulfill. The unfortunate result is insecure managers who are afraid to ask for help or rely on the existing teams who actually know what they're doing. The outcome is that leadership role are filled by incompetent outsiders instead of internal subject matter experts.","Cultivate better managers by encouraging high-performing subject matter experts to develop their leadership skills.

The products are tailored to fit needs across all walks of life and the policies to deal with real issues offering real world meaniful solutions.,In the struggle to become the Best we sometimes forget that in most cases we have gone from bad to good.

"" No one is cut out to be sales person"" Frank Bettger How I Raised Myself from A Failure To Success in Sales. With That being said. The recruitment phase is done in a mass herd type of way. This does not allow your process to be as effective as it could and should be. The training is not consistent with the demands of the business. I feel it should be an everyday three to four hour event. With the Partners going out with the new hires in the evening.
