Quicken Loans,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Quicken-Loans-Reviews-E7856.htm,2/13/2019, Recruiter,"Detroit, MI",Current Employee ,Working at Quicken Loans Family of Companies,More than a year,0,"Pretty solid environment, work hard and get equal results.","Hours can get long if you're not careful, but if you're efficient that shouldn't be an issue.",Isms are fun.,5,4,5,5,5,4
Quicken Loans,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Quicken-Loans-Reviews-E7856.htm,2/8/2019, Mortgage Banker,,Former Employee ,DO NOT WORK HERE (5 stars so it doesn’t get buried),More than a year,0,,"Horrible company to work for. Their sales tactics are overly pushy and questionable, and the people who run the company are all bros that peaked in college (more on this to come).

During my time here, I had multiple “leaders” and I was instructed to mislead clients into options that had no benefit. You sell on their ignorance. If a client doesn’t realize they’re losing money over 30 years, you sell it. You’ll be told to sell the worst loans so your leaders can win competitions.

You’re not allowed to leave your desk - sometimes they bring in breakfast, lunch AND dinner so you stay at your desk and on the phones all day. Recently i was off the phone for 30 minutes and the regional director asked where i was - i was eating lunch and once i was done my team had a meeting on why it’s not acceptable to leave the phones that long.

“Leaders” will insult you - they say they’re just playing but we all know how it is. You’ll be sworn at and called names and expect you to “laugh it off.”

The compensation plans and the company in general are very misleading - if you’re not hitting their unrealistic goals, expect to make enough for the month to barely get by if you have low expenses. I would recommend anyone who is looking into this company to think twice before accepting a position. I was bought in by the “fun work environment” and “culture.”

They promote this idea that it's a fun work environment - again, that’s how i was sold. The office theme is much like The Great Gatsby, with the bright colors throughout and fancy decor. There’s a ping pong table, pool table, popcorn machines, slushy machines, free snacks (which get old after a month), Golden Tee, tricycles, etc.. You can enjoy those either during training your first month or lunch (again, god forbid you take more than 20 minutes out of a 10+ hour day to eat lunch).

They push you and push you until there isn't a single ounce of energy left in you. They brainwash you into thinking that working 70+ hour work weeks is the norm, where if you work a 60 hour week you don’t want to succeed and have no drive. They select favorites and who gets better lead flow, and you’re given recycled leads that top mortgage bankers failed to sell (for obvious reasons: low credit score, no income, bankruptcy, etc. aka you’re wasting the clients time with false hope).

This job is the definition of Modern Day Slavery. If you drink the kool-aid and become brainwashed to thinking this is normal and a great company to work for, have at it. They act like they own you and shame you for wanting to have a work/life balance.",,5,1,1,1,1,1

Quicken Loans,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Quicken-Loans-Reviews-E7856.htm,4/16/2019, Mortgage Banker,"Detroit, MI",Current Employee ,Opportunity comes at a cost,More than a year,0,"If you are willing to trade in your time for the opportunity to build an amazing career, this is a great place. It's a fast-paced sales job, and you need to be willing to work 7:30-9:00pm, most days, 5-6 days a week, most weeks, period. Do that, and follow the amazing coaching and leadership to a tee, and you'll succeed. Try to go your own way, or to do anything short of close, close close the sale... you'll struggle. Your pay is based on exceeding goal, and goal is meant to be met by half the region or so. Hit goal and you'll see $2800/mo hourly plus about $4000 commission.

You can absolutely find success. The team gives you every single opportunity to be financially set, however as a banker, it is accepted that you will not have a life outside of work, period. After 4 years of extremely high success and hours, you may become a level 5 President's Club banker, who can sometimes work from home but will enjoy $20,000 in commissions each month for the same volume that earns intro bankers $4,000-10,000. That's the tradeoff: time for payscale and some flexibility.","Miss goal, even by one or two, and you'll be looking at $2800 hourly and around $1000 commission. For 70 hours a week (yes, 70, no matter what your tiering is), you better be pushing yourself to earn the business. Not to mention, clients drop out of process, no big deal. Just be sure you write enough business to make up for the hit.

You will be free most days from 8-10pm, and maybe one day a weekend. You are expected to come into the office on weekends, and encouraged to come both days. Goal is meant to be hit, and you are meant to come in 27 out of 30 days a month, believe it.","Get rid of ACE compensation; it's discouraging your bankers and encouraging seasoned talent to look elsewhere. We desperately need to make compensation competitive again because we all know it isn't. Our bankers are getting snatched up left and right by less proficient companies, and that is because of a mindset of ""marketshare > our people"". I love this company and our culture, however the way bankers view their worth is often in a way that will surely have a negative and lasting impact on our culture.",3,1,5,5,2,4

Family like culture among team members.
Ability to learn and grow.
Career advancement.","Compliance area difficult.
Communication between leaders and senior leadership poor.
Leadership and Sr Leadership has poor understanding of new roles with SAFe methodology.
Leaders don't hold team members with difficulty with time management and no self organization accountable.
Leader and team member on boarding is non existent for new and returning members.
Too green of leaders not held accountable.
Have programs for leadership that are corky and unrealistic to everyday leadership.
With the SAFe model, leadership doesn't understand their additional responsibility.
Working with legal stakeholders is difficult.
Legal team members are bullish, demanding and blow up scope.
Legal team members believe everything is a ""hair on fire"" situation and ""want it done yesterday"" even if they just mentioned it.
Leadership programs make it seem like their leaders believe in the culture, but in reality life that's not how it works.","Improve your communication.
Teach your new leaders, just because there are leadership programs doesn't mean they know how to lead.
Push back on legal stakeholders to really define their priority as everything cannot be done yesterday when they tell us the same day.
This leads to a very high anxiety, high strung, and tense relationship with them. You have allowed a legal team member to bully technology team members into doing their bidding. Team members are afraid to speak up and defend themselves against that and poor leaders. Leadership does not get rid of poor quality team members, it is almost as if they protect them. Which doesn't make sense because they are a waste of time, money, and sufficate the potential for hard working highly skilled team members to be hired.
Since Dan and Bill have not been directly overseeing the company anymore I'm afraid there has been a continued downward trend of the culture. After seven years the technology with compliance side has almost completely lost the culture except for a few leaders. Over the last three years I have seen more team members jump ship to get out of legal compliance area either warm transfer or getting jobs outside of QL. The area is toxic, the leadership is poor (albiet a fee leaders). There's no true sense of directional leadership except the bullying from legal business team members (really one specifically). I really enjoyed working for QL over the last seven years and only hope for the best that they can recover on the legal technology side the culture that has made QL who it is today.",4,4,2,4,3,1

Looks good on your resume. I learned a lot about the industry.","Toxic leadership in marketing. Your success at QL is based on your relationship with your leader and how much schmoozing you're willing to do. Tons of cliques and popularity contests. Leadership does not listen its employees and when they do, the response and/or action is halfhearted. HR does nothing and nobody is held accountable. They also do not care how you would like to shape your career, it's more about what they want you to do. The majority of leadership is white, male, and 40+. Not one African-American or other minority. Tons of threatening rude e-mails. Lots of expectations but no formal training or explanations. People are often held accountable for things they knew nothing about and when the fires come burning down, everyone is standing around confused and somehow, it's your fault, then ding there goes your bonus or raise. Pay is extraordinarily low.","Stop scheduling so many meetings for leadership to pontificate for hours on action items that could've been an e-mail. Create a culture where team leaders are able to develop better working relationships with their team by actually spending time with them and not drive by one on ones that aren't valuable. Hire more minorities and if you choose not to, stop boasting about diversity and inclusion just because there's a diversity and inclusion team - there's literally no diversity. Hold your directors more accountable for the team as they set the tone. If there's an absentee director, don't you think that's also a reflection of how the team operates? Also, stop peddling the ""I went to bat for you"" to buy loyalty. It doesn't work.",2,1,1,2,2,1
