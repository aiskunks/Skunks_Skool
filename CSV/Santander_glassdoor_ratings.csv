I can only speak for my limited view of the company when I write this, but the word on the street often gives Santander a bad reputation in terms of being a desirable place to work. My exposure so far sees this view as unwarranted or out-of-date.","It is a big, international bank and comes with many of the challenges facing companies of this size. There's a lot of red tape, processes, and inefficiency. It does seem that the company is taking on many of these challenges but there needs to be a continued commitment for improvements to continue. If you've worked in a big bank before, none of these challenges will be new or surprising to you. If you are used to small companies that can move quickly and desire a work environment like that, then this is not your best fit.",Keep working to pare red tape and streamline internal processes that can make it harder for employees to perform their job functions effectively. It seems based on my limited knowledge that these efforts are underway and I look forward to seeing the results of continued efforts.,4,3,3,5,4,3
