- People left the company (either fired or found a better opportunity) and the company does not fill those vacancies. The ones left have to pick up all the work with no salary increase or compensation.
- No bonus
- No career advancement opportunity at all. Because you are given too much work to do. Of course, you are unable to excel since it's way more than the workload you can handle. At year end review, the company use this against you and give you a bad rating. Thus, you do not get any salary increase nor bonus.

You'll spend a lot of time either navigating or being otherwise effected by cartoonish social politics. Many managers and directors come from middle-class backgrounds and see their job as an opportunity to become part of some elite ruling class. It's completely divorced from reality, and actual rich people don't behave like this.

The Operations team is expected to say ""yes"" to every request thrown at them, without any regard for priority. When you're handling $15,000 in diamond jewelry, or have all the cash the store took in the prior day on your desk, you can't just get up and walk away from it to get a customer a glass of water just because one of the sales team is freaking out over it. As ridiculous as this sounds, management can, and has, reprimanded operations team members for not doing exactly this.

There are also a lot of cynical efforts made to use Operations people as salespeople, in part because our commission rate is lower (but the hourly *is* higher).

HR seems to protect managers who act inappropriately. Countless claims were made in good faith against a store director who acted inappropriately around women and made crucial decisions based (at least in part) on race. It wasn't even a secret that any of this was happening, but no remedial action was taken. Because of this, the store suffered a turnover rate close to 100%.

No career growth opportunities, with promotions seemingly based on favoritism or nepotism.

Operational expenses are poorly decided upon, like continuing to purchase 15 bottles of silver polish per month, despite only using 1 bottle per month, which leads to spoilage and, ultimately, waste. The company also decided to opt for more expensive hand soap for the bathrooms while simultaneously planning layoffs.

Ancient computer systems - younger employees think they're being Punk'd when they're presented with AS/400.

Oh, and Google the time they conspired to fire an African-American store manager over race.","I seriously have no advice that this company's ""leadership"" would follow. Nobody wants this product or experience anymore, and you don't treat your employees fairly. I'd say the writing's on the wall.",1,2,1,1,1,1

Quiet, the occasional lookie loo, and not busy.",More than a year,0,"Product discount, luxury experience, and some of my coworkers.
Brand recognition, beautiful product, low stress/ pressure unless you count low commission checks.","If you have been here more than 6 years you should have a pretty full book of clients that are repeat purchasers. However, less than 3 years, and you will struggle to hit your sales goal 6 out of 12 months. It's truly luck of the draw on customers. It's an up system at a lot of stores and you can wait over an hour between clients - it's that slow. No one is coming in to buy.
Example: My up turn I may get the person dropping off a cleaning or someone who has never been in Tiffany and just wants to take pictures. The next sales person gets the serious client who drops $10,000-$50,000. It's a lot of luck.
No more goal adjustment on vacation or sick days.
No more individual bonus if you're doing well; it's now a team bonus based on the stores results.
Language skill employees not only earn more per hour, they also get half of your sell if they assist in translation. That's if they decide to help you or if they don't snake the sell for themselves.
1% commission payout.
 If you're lucky to get in to management - you make a nice salary to sit in your office checking facebook, booking yoga classes, and not actually having to develop your team.","Rethink how many stores you truly need for a luxury brand.
We need mens jewelry and cologne! Our current offering is sad.
Management should earn a base plus commission. If they have to rely on their stores performance for pay, they will be more engaged and drive sales instead of sitting in an office, posting meme's and collecting a steady check.
Make sure your management team has sales experience.
Instead of cutting pay, cut expenses. Change your transfer policy for jewelry; this will save a ton in overnight shipping and high value insurance coverage. The amount of plastic bags and tissue paper we go through is insane. Our ""customers"" use us for free fancy water without buying a thing. We don't recycle.",2,3,3,2,2,2
