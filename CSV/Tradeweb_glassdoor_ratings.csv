Great benefits including time off for volunteer work.","Office space - a highly profitable FinTech company can do much better. And that's a huge understatement.

Technology is dated, teams are siloed, and access to people/information is strictly controlled. Deviation from strict access control is not tolerated. This limits flow of information, and stifles innovation.","Listen to employee feedback/suggestions, encourage collaboration, empower employees to innovate, and reward on merit rather than personal relationships or tenure.

IPO in 2019 has long been rumored and management should make sure everyone has skin in the game by giving pre-IPO equity to ALL employees. It would be a colossal mistake to only give equity to SOME employees. Please avoid creating 2-tiers of employees at this exciting time - morale and productivity will take a nosedive.",5,4,5,4,4,4

Company is well positioned to succeed. Kitchens are usually well stocked and offices are clean. Most people are serious about the work they do and very capable. The atmosphere is generally positive and energetic.","Way too much focus on execution and sales rather than innovation. Tradeweb is a technology company. Couldn't emphasize this more - it's an electronic brokerage. Technology should be the sole focus of day to day, month to month, and year to year operations. Instead this is a sales company that can't seem to plan effectively more than a few months in advance. It's difficult to be rewarded for being creative and efficient vs. putting in extra time and knowing the right people. There's a culture clash between NY and NJ, sales people vs. technologists",CTO/CEO must get involved with the day to day development of software.
