ZS Associates,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/ZS-Associates-Reviews-E115506.htm,3/17/2019, Business Analyst,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,High Stress and Toxic Work Culture,More than a year,0,"A lot of client facing experience and accelerates your career, particularly if you're looking to do an MBA down the line","- Poor oversight by management on new college grads, effectively leaving them in the charge of other associates who have no management experience or training. (In my case, reviews for junior associates are essentially written by the senior associate, using the Manager's name) Because of this, associate experience can vary dramatically, from OK to toxic/terrible. I was unfortunate to fall on the latter end of the spectrum.
- Long working hours, high stress, unhealthy work-life balance (not uncommon to work 70-90 hours a week), very thankless leadership for all the hours put in
-Management thinks about client demands first and employee welfare second (and are very obvious about it)
-The tools used for analytics are extremely outdated, poor analytics and statistical practices. This isn't the place to level up your technical skills (but it is the place to level up client-facing skills)
- Poor compensation for the hours put in
- I ultimately left ZS due to the terrible work culture and am mentally healthier and happier in my new job.","You have high turnover for a reason, treat your people right",1,1,1,4,1,1

ZS Associates,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/ZS-Associates-Reviews-E115506.htm,1/28/2019, Strategy Insights & Planning Associate,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Incredibly varied experience depending on team,More than a year,0,"You will be challenged, whether it is figuring out how to manage your professional development, dealing with difficult clients, balancing multiple projects. ZS will throw many issues your way, and many times you will need to solve them, though there will be people available to support you. This makes for great storytelling if you decide to leave or go to business school. While ZS doesn't have a super strong brand outside of pharma, the problem solving you learn will be transferrable.","Not everyone has your interests in mind. If you don't actively have conversations about promotions and projects, you'll be stuck where you don't want to be. Project experience is still driven primarily by staffing need. Because of the offshore team, you also might not get the extensive technical skills you want, such as in Excel or analytics, because it's just easier to hand it over to them, especially when things get busy.","Create more similar experiences for all associates.

ZS Associates,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/ZS-Associates-Reviews-E115506.htm,2/9/2019, Decision Analytics Associate,"Philadelphia, PA",Former Employee ,"Horrible hours, unhappy people, disproportionately low pay for work/time required",Less than a year,0,Nice office with free snacks,"-Multiple projects at once (I was on 3, and I knew someone who was on 5)
-Working 60 hour weeks but being guilted into recording 40 to 50
-Regularly stuck doing work until midnight, sometimes later, with meetings scheduled at 7:30 am the next morning
-After asking to take the evening off starting at 7pm for Halloween, my manager told me ""you can switch to part-time if you only want to work 40 hours per week, like one of our consultants who is going through chemotherapy"". This was literally the only time I ever asked if I could have the evening off.
-I was allowed to leave ""early"" once a week to catch a 6pm yoga class, but it was hugely frowned upon, and I was expected to be back online minutes after the class ended
-My bonus was affected by my low ratings that were clearly due to a personal issue my boss had with me or his unconscious bias against women (as the only woman on the team and the only one being treated badly by him, I couldn't tell which it was). When I brought it up with my ""personal development coach"", she told my boss what I said, and he told me he's been cold to me due to his mother dying. It's terrible that happened, but it's not an excuse to single out one person and treat them badly.
-Parents don't have time for their children, young people don't have time to date or make friends, everyone is miserable and overworked
-High turnover",Work to reduce unconscious bias against women. Stop promoting people who don't work well with others. Allow employees to have a life outside of work.,1,1,1,2,1,2
