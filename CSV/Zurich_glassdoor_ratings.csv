Good benefits—-they did away with the pension plan though
New home office with gym and nice cafeteria","It is hard to know where to begin.

1. If you are an Underwriter, expect to be doing data entry, you clear and register new business yourself, you have to fill out a 200+ data points in an excel spreadsheet for rating and then expect to get 4-5 emails from rating to clarify before getting it back. Rating is in India so there is a language and comprehension barrier but upper management doesn’t care. It takes about 4 hours to clear one piece of new business and fingers crossed the system doesn’t error out, if you report errors to the ASC expect to hear it’s all good because you eventually got it to clear.
2. Live and die by the underwriting model.
3. Expect to spend 50% of your time in meetings.
4. Expect to be a yes person without the ability to provide solutions.
5. Expect a ridiculous micromanaged environment with a last minute fire drill almost every day so management knows where performance is at (a problem that could be solved with better systems).
6. Systems do not work so expect to spend 50% of your time on items that should be automated and that are data entry.
7. The appetite is being dramatically narrowed, to the point where Middle Markets is only focused on certain areas and best of class business. Well that is what everyone wants, you have to take the good with the bad!
8. Retention is down considerably and no one is writing new business. There are senior Underwriters who haven’t written new business.
9. Brokers don’t trust Zurich and are not placing new business with them.
10. There is an extreme lack of accountability with the underwriting assistants, their goals are different from underwriting so they don’t care about writing new business and what’s important.
11. Turnover is insane. Underwriters are leaving at a fast pace.",I don’t have advice for management. Nothing that is above is any different than what has been said by multiple people.,1,1,1,1,1,1
Zurich,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Zurich-Insurance-Group-Reviews-E582526.htm,3/13/2018, IT Project Lead,"Schaumburg, IL",Current Employee ,Extremely toxic management,More than 5 years,0,Good work life balance and pay,"-Most IT manager have no people management experience and company is not investing in hiring good managers or training existing ones to manage people
-A lot of bad management decisions made because it is an ""enabled"" from higher up
- Too much favoritism and politics within teams to keep 'friends' with no skills around
- Firing anyone who raises questions against the manager is a common practice
- Year end review process has no basis- most managers doesn't even know what the people work on
- No meritocracy
- Hiring family friends has become a common practice in IT","Upper management should actively seek anonymous feed backs on managers from employees and investigate the concerns. When you hire people manager , make sure you train them . Being good at writing technical specs or do business analysis doesn't make you a good people manager- hire people with some management experience. When you hire at level 7 and up make sure they are not bringing in only technical know how but good communication skills and management experience. There are manager who never conducted a team meeting and no one knows what others are doing in the team. Lack of transparency is to hide what is going on with regards to the work responsibilities and how people are rated.",1,5,1,1,4,1

Multiple people in my department are out on workers compensation for stress and new hires often stop showing up after the first 90 days. Excessive smoking and drinking seems to be the norm. Very few people have a positive career outlook. When concerns are brought up to management, employees are told they ""ought to be great fully you have a job"" as if the Zurich gods mercifully gave you one when you don't deserve it. The attrition rate is terrible. The promotion process is 9 times out of 10 based on favoritism and time with the company. I've seen the company lose plenty of high quality employees because a promotion was given to someone outside the company or someone whose main job function involved kissing up.","Being rude to your employees and treating them like dirt WILL hurt your bottom line.

Tough to survive in this mix-master unless you are a real suck-up to management. Does not value diversity of opinion. The Swiss are a real piece of work. Not really all that smart but forceful in their presentation. It's so large that I think there is little management can do to damage or improve the firm. Culture in Schaumburg is horrible. Lot's of turn-over of senior management. Lack of direction - who do they want to be today? Lot's of people heading to meetings or looking for something to do.

Sense of teamwork. Good benefits.,"Non-transparent management. Managers only give lip service to employee engagement and performance trumps strategy. Hit the numbers or hit the road mentality. Your IDP is given lip service with no help by managers to get to you to your career goal. Stagnant company that is not positioned to move forward and be profitable. HR is not your friend. IT is way behind the times. Company says they are competitive, but proof is in the numbers 3 to 5 years from now. High performers are not recognized or rewarded.","Be honest with your employees. If you sell to the customer and market that Zurich values employee engagement then live what you sell and truly value your employees. Cronyism has to end or the Peter Principle will continue to harm this once great company under the leadership of Jim Schiro. Promote high performers in the company, not ""yes"" men/women. Reward feedback and stop punishing dissent or other ideas. The strategy of shrinking to be profitable will hurt in the long run as your competition will gobble up your once loyal customers. Show loyalty to long-term productive employees and stop pushing them out of the door and replacing them with inexperienced but way cheaper persons.",1,3,1,1,4,1

Get rid of middle and top management that know nothing about the industry or the actual duties being performed. They make rules and procedures that are completely nonsense and do not apply to this type of work, such as lien manufacturing, and cross selling insurance products. Auditors are auditors and every insured is unique. Management does not realize this after how many years in business. They expect a 15 hour audit to take 3 hours...according to their algorithm (obviously produced by a non-auditor). They do NOT care about their employees, instead they are condescending and deliberately malicious, lying to downgrade you at every review. There is no respect for employees otherwise they would listen to them and run the business based on reality, not college textbook methods and overzealous methodology that does not work for the underwriting and auditing departments.

Since the North American Executive team drove the US business off the cliff, the boys club will do anything to justify their existence driving unfair hiring practices from the oustide and from within the organization. While the Schaumburg team sits in their brand new shiny office space - while other employees are sitting on top of each other or don't even have a place to sit because of overcrowding because of consolidated office spaces to save $.","Need a new leadership team and a new message to inspire and lead the company again. A leadership team with experience in leading companies - not consulting contracts. It can't include the US CEO bragging about his personal shopper at Nordstrom's, or his new shiny Mercedes experience - completely disconnected from what's happening around him. It can't include the US CFO bragging about a new house with a membership to a golf club and feeling sad her kids will miss their old personal swimming pool. The damage has been done, but the US Executimes pretend they did not and do not continue to make bad decisions around the wrong models they forced UWs to use or the fact the culture became so internally focused, that so many high level leaders left market facing activities to a sales team.",1,1,1,1,1,1
