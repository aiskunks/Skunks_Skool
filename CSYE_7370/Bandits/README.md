# Bandit Problems

Think of a real-world Bernoulli trial other than slots. Remember a Bernoulli trial (or binomial trial) is a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes, "success" and "failure." This could click on a link or not click, buy or not buy etc. Get some data on the real range of probability for your real-world simulation. For example, how often does someone click on an ad?

Create the simulation and model it. Your simulation MUST have a real-world analogy such as picking a movie, the best ice cream, an online course, etc. Create a folder within https://github.com/aiskunks/Skunks_Skool/tree/main/CSYE_7370/Bandits (Links to an external site.) with the topic of the bandit as its name.

It is OK to use any code that you cite.  For example, from the notebook by Andre Cianflone - Thompson sampling https://github.com/andrecianflone/thompson/blob/master/thompson.ipynb .

 

Optimize your Bandit Problem using Thompson Sampling, e-greedy, UBC, and random sampling.

Answer the following questions 

Which hyperparameters are important for Thompson Sampling, e-greedy, UBC, and random sampling? Show that they are important (15 Points) 

How does the action space affect Thompson Sampling, e-greedy, UBC, and random sampling? Show why. (15 Points) 

How does stationary affect Thompson Sampling, e-greedy, UBC, and random sampling? Show why. (15 Points) 

When do Thompson Sampling, e-greedy, UBC, and random sampling stop exploring? Explain why. Explain the exploration-exploitation tradeoff (15 Points) 

How long do Thompson Sampling, e-greedy, UBC, and random sampling remember the past actions? Explain your answer. (10 Points) 

Thompson Sampling with non-Beta distribution (5 Points) Modify the Thompson Sampling to run with a different distribution (e.g. Parteo, Normal, etc)

What code is yours and what have you adapted? (10 Points)

You must explain what code you wrote and what you have done that is different. Failure to cite ANY code will result in a zero for this section.

Did I explain my code clearly? (10 Points) Your code review score will be scaled to a range of 0 to 10 and be used for this score.

Did I explain my licensing clearly? (5 Points) Failure to cite a clear license will result in a zero for this section.
