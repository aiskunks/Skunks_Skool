    "\n",
    "## 2. What are the states, the actions, and the size of the Q-table? (5 Points)\n",
    "n the environment, the states are RGB images of the screen, which is an array of shape (210,160,3). The images are selected every 4 frame during the episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions are in range [0,1,2,3,4,5], which has the corresponding names ['NOOP', 'FIRE', 'RIGHT', 'LEFT', 'RIGHTFIRE', 'LEFTFIRE']. In which, 0 & 1 are staying, 2 & 4 make the green player go up, and 3 & 5 make the green player go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What are the rewards? Why did you choose them? (5 Points)\n",
    " \n",
    "In the Pong game, the reward is calculated by the score of my player minus the score of other player, in range[-21,21]. The advantage of the reward is easy to calculate and process. Because there is only one round in one episode, the reward will not be averaged. I choose to calculate the average reward in last 100 rounds to be a stable reference.\n",
    "## 4. How did you choose alpha and gamma in the Bellman equation? Try at least one additional value for alpha and gamma. How did it change the baseline performance?  (5 Points)\n",
    "Alpha is the learning rate that decides how important the new, learned Q-value is. The bigger the alpha is, the more percentage the new Q-value takes.\n",
    "Gamma is the discount factor that decides how important the future Q-value is. The bigger the gamma is, the future optimal Q-value is more important.\n",
    "Firstly, I chose a different alpha to try with a smaller learning rate.:\n",
    "\n",
    "GAMMA = 0.8  # Old Discount rate\n",
    "ALPHA = 0.00025  # New Learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the experiment, I changed the learning rate from 0.7 to 0.00025. The smaller learning rate performs quicker and better learning result. According to the Bellman equation, I think it is because the small learning rate could make the model converge quickly and stablly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I choose a different gamma:\n",
    "\n",
    "GAMMA = 0.97  # New Discount rate\n",

    "## 5. Try a policy other than e-greedy. How did it change the baseline performance? (5 Points)\n",
    " Within about 400 episodes, the ramdom sampling policy with the above optimal parameters is similar to the baseline performance with e-greed. But according to the average rewards of last 100 episodes, ramdom sampling is -20.34 while the baseline is -20.44, which is 0.5% better than the baseline performance with e-greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. How did you choose your decay rate and starting epsilon? Try at least one additional value for epsilon and the decay rate. How did it change the baseline performance? What is the value of epsilon when if you reach the max steps per episode? (5 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Epsilon is the hyperparameter of e-greedy algorithm. It will decide the ratio between exploration and exploidation. The bigger epsilon is, the more exploration the program does. In the beginning, the agent knows nothing about the program, so it should do more exploration to find the proper actions. After training for a while, the agent has been more confident to choose correct action in a state, so the epsilon should be decayed to make the agent do more exploidation. In the tail of training, there should be a small epsilon to ensure the program will do what it think correct at most of time but try something new sometime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What is the average number of steps taken per episode? (5 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps stop counting when the game is over, so with the training, the game last longer, the average steps also will be more. These are the steps of 440 episodes with the optimal parameters and the average steps of the 440 episodes is 1858.814. We could see that although steps are not stable, the trend of average steps are obviously growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Does Q-learning use value-based or policy-based iteration? (5 Points)\n",
    "Explain, not a yes or no question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning is a values-based learning algorithm. Value based algorithms updates the value function based on an equation(particularly Bellman equation). Whereas the other type, policy-based estimates the value function with a greedy policy obtained from the last policy improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Could you use SARSA for this problem? (5 Points)\n",
    "Yes\n",
    "SARSA algorithm is a slight variation of the popular Q-Learning algorithm. For a learning agent in any Reinforcement Learning algorithm it’s policy can be of two types:- \n",
    "\n",
    "On Policy: In this, the learning agent learns the value function according to the current action derived from the policy currently being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Off Policy: In this, the learning agent learns the value function according to the action derived from another policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning technique is an Off Policy technique and uses the greedy approach to learn the Q-value. SARSA technique, on the other hand, is an On Policy and uses the action performed by the current policy to learn the Q-value.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## 10. What is meant by the expected lifetime value in the Bellman equation?(5 Points)\n",
    "Explain, not a yes or no question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The expected lifetime related to the value of being in a state to the utility return in the state and expected change from moving to another state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. When would SARSA likely do better than Q-learning? (5 Points)\n",
    "Explain, not a yes or no question. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your goal is to train an optimal agent in simulation, or in a low-cost and fast-iterating environment, then Q-learning is a good choice, due to the first point (learning optimal policy directly). If your agent learns online, and you care about rewards gained whilst learning, then SARSA may be a better choice.\n",

    "## 12. How does SARSA differ from Q-learning? (5 Points)  \n",
