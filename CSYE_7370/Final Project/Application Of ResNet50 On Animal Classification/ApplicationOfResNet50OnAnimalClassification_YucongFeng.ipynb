    "# 1\tINTRODUCTION\n",
    "With the decline of traditional taxonomy research, there are fewer and fewer taxonomy experts, but there are still a large number of animal and plant specimens and photos that need to be quickly identified and identified; at the same time, field natural education is gradually rising, which needs to be able to quickly identify species and provide relevant tools. Some popular image recognition networks, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, and InceptionV1-V4 network, are widely used in image recognition. Since I want our classified image to have higher precision, I chose the ResNet50 as the network I use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Network 50 is a powerful tool in the state of image recognition. Many types of research have been conducted around this topic, and this mode advanced dramatically in recent years. This model was immensely successful, as can be ascertained from the fact that its ensemble won the top position at the ILSVRC 2015 classification competition with an error of only 3.57%. Additionally, it also came first in the ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in the ILSVRC & COCO competitions of 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset of animals is collected from the internet. Figure 1 shows a part of the dataset. This training dataset has a total of 12 different categories of animals, and each category has about 600 different images, a total of 7096 images.\n"

    "\n",
    "**1）ResNet50 Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original ResNet architecture was ResNet-34, which comprised 34 weighted layers. It provided a novel way to add more convolutional layers to a CNN, without running into the vanishing gradient problem, using the concept of shortcut connections [4]. A shortcut connection “skips over” some layers, converting a regular network to a residual network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regular network was based on the VGG neural networks (VGG-16 and VGG-19)—each convolutional network had a 3×3 filter. However, a ResNet has fewer filters and is less complex than a VGGNet. A 34-layer ResNet can achieve a performance of 3.6 billion FLOPs, and a smaller 18-layer ResNet can achieve 1.8 billion FLOPs, which is significantly faster than a VGG-19 Network with 19.6 billion FLOPs. Figure 3 shows the difference between these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ResNet architecture follows two basic design rules: First, the number of filters in each layer is the same depending on the size of the output feature map. Second, if the feature map’s size is halved, it has double the number of filters to maintain the time complexity of each layer. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "ResNet-50 has an architecture based on the model depicted above, but with one important difference. The 50-layer ResNet uses a bottleneck design for the building block. A bottleneck residual block uses 1×1 convolutions, known as a “bottleneck”, which reduces the number of parameters and matrix multiplications. This enables much faster training of each layer. It uses a stack of three layers rather than two layers. \n",
    "The 50-layer ResNet architecture includes the following elements, as shown in the figure 5 below: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A 7×7 kernel convolution alongside 64 other kernels with a 2-sized stride; \n",
    "2. A max pooling layer with a 2-sized stride; 9 more layers—3×3,64 kernel convolution, another with 1×1,64 kernels, and a third with 1×1,256 kernels. These 3 layers are repeated 3 times; \n",
    "3. 12 more layers with 1×1,128 kernels, 3×3,128 kernels, and 1×1,512 kernels, iterated 4 times; \n",
    "4. 18 more layers with 1×1,256 cores, and 2 cores 3×3,256 and 1×1,1024, iterated 6 times; \n",
    "5. 9 more layers with 1×1,512 cores, 3×3,512 cores, and 1×1,2048 cores iterated 3 times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2）Residual blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual blocks are the essential building blocks of ResNet networks. To make very deep convolutional structures possible, ResNet adds intermediate inputs to the output of a group of convolution blocks. This is also called skip connections, identity mapping, and “residual connections.\n",
    "The objective of skip connections is to allow smoother gradient flow, and ensure important features carry until the final layers. They do not add computational load to the network.\n",

    "\n",
    "Random Sampling: In a simple random sample (SRS) of a given size, all subsets of a sampling frame have an equal probability of being selected. Each element of the frame thus has an equal probability of selection: the frame is not subdivided or partitioned. Furthermore, any given pair of elements has the same chance of selection as any other such pair. This minimizes bias and simplifies analysis of results. In particular, the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population, which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results.\n"

    "# CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, it demonstrates that ResNet can make great classification. Fortunately, the result shows a good demonstration of accuracy. However, I believe there should be a more detailed way to quantify the result comprehensively, maybe next time I should try to find some other evaluation metrics to measure the performance of this model. For example, we use Manhattan distance to measure the accuracy of K-means or Fréchet inception distance (FID) in generative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, residual network or ResNet was a major innovation that has changed the training of deep convolutional neural networks for tasks related to computer vision. While the original Resnet had 34 layers and used 2-layer blocks, other advanced variants such as the Resnet50 made the use of 3-layer bottleneck blocks to ensure improved accuracy and lesser training time. \n"
