With the development of science and technology, people in modern society pay more and more attention to the classification, recycling and treatment of garbage. In terms of garbage disposal, how to classify unsorted messy garbage has always been a problem that plagues environmentalists. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning methods to solve this problem. We use deep learning algorithms to identify garbage images, so as to achieve the purpose of classification and processing. The algorithm chosen to be used is the YOLO(You Only Look Once) algorithm. In order to make its effect matchable, we also chose the CNN(Convolutional neural network) algorithm.

PS. We uploaded the whole project in Canvas, and only uploaded two core models of .ipynb files on github. Our processed data for YOLOv5 model will be train_data.zip file under file we submitted in canvas.


We have added more complete model training results and model performance evaluation graphs to the report.


Some predicted results are showed below:
