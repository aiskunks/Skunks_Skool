# Image Generation with Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, or GANs

Submission: Put the data and Jupyter notebook files in a folder. Make sure all links to data are relative to the folder so the notebooks can be run.
Find an image dataset other than MNIST or CIFAR. The image dataset must be pre-approved by the TA. It also cannot be the same image dataset as another student in the class unless it is TMINST.


TMNIST. For TMNIST-Alphabet (94 characters and over 281,000 images)<br>

Generative Architecture (60 Points)<br>
Use a generative architecture (Autoencoders, GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models)<br>
Create at least 40 fake images using ONE of the generative architectures. How well did it do?  Adjust the size of the latent space. Change the network architecture. What combination of network architecture and latent space size gives the best trade-off between compression and quality?
