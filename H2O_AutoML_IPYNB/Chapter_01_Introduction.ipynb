    "- Vector of p predictor measurements X (also called inputs, regressors, covariates, features, independent variables).\n",
    "- In the regression problem, Y is quantitative (e.g price, blood pressure).\n",
    "- In the classification problem, Y takes values in a finite, unordered set (survived/died, digit 0-9, cancer class of tissue sample).\n",
    "- We have training data (x1, y1), . . . ,(xN , yN ). These are observations (examples, instances) of these measurements."
