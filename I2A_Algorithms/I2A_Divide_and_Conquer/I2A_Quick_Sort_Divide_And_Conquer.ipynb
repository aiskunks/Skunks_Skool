    "## **Quick Sort**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Sort was first developed by a British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959. The name \"Quick Sort\" comes from the fact that, quick sort is capable of sorting a list of data elements significantly faster (twice or thrice faster) than any of the common sorting algorithms. It is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms and is based on the splitting of an array (partition) into smaller ones and swapping (exchange) based on the comparison with 'pivot' element selected. Due to this, quick sort is also called as \"Partition Exchange\" sort. Like Merge sort, Quick sort also falls into the category of divide and conquer approach of problem-solving methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort is basically a representative of three types of sorting algorithms: **divide and conquer**, **in-place**, and **unstable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divide and conquer**: Quicksort splits the array into smaller arrays until it ends up with an empty array, or one that has only one element, before recursively sorting the larger arrays.\n",
    "- **In place**: Quicksort doesn't create any copies of the array or any of its subarrays. It does however require stack memory for all the recursive calls it makes.\n",
    "- **Unstable**: A _stable_ sorting algorithm is the one in which elements with the same value appear in the same relative order in the sorted array as they do before the array is sorted. An _unstable_ sorting algorithm doesn't guarantee this, it _can_ of course happen, but it isn't guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer approach based on the idea of choosing one element as a pivot element and partitioning the array around it such that: Left side of pivot contains all the elements that are less than the pivot element Right side contains all elements greater than the pivot. Finally, the algorithm recursively sorts the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot element.\n",

    "## **Comparing Quick Sort with Merge Sort**\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Auxiliary Space : Quick sort is an in-place sorting algorithm whereas Merge sort uses extra space. In-place sorting means no additional storage space is used to perform sorting (except recursion stack). Merge sort requires a new temporary array to merge the sorted arrays thereby making Quick sort the better option.\n",
    "-   Worst Cases : The worst case runtime of quick sort is **O(n2)** can be avoided by using randomized quicksort as explained in the previous point. Obtaining average case behavior by choosing random pivot element improves the performance and becomes as efficient as merge sort.\n",

    "2.  Divide the stack of papers into two. A-L and M-Z. It is not necessary that the piles should be equal.\n",
    "3.  Repeat the above two steps with the A-L pile, splitting it into its significant two halves. And M-Z pile, split into its halves. The process is repeated until the piles are small enough to be sorted easily.\n",
    "4.  Ultimately, the smaller piles can be placed one on top of the other to produce a fully sorted and ordered set of papers.\n",
    "5.  The approach used here is **reduction** at each split to get to the single-element array.\n",
    "6.  At every split, the pile was divided and then the same approach was used for the smaller piles by using the method of recursion.\n",

    "\n",
    "As seen before , the algorithm can be broken down into three parts​​:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Partitioning the array about the pivot.\n",
    "2.  Passing the smaller arrays to the recursive calls.\n",
    "3.  Joining the sorted arrays that are returned from the recursive call and the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Make any element as pivot:** Decide any value to be the pivot from the list. For convenience of code, we often select the rightmost index as pivot or select any at random and swap with rightmost. Suppose for two values “Low” and “High” corresponding to the first index and last index respectively.\n",
    "    -   In our case low is 0 and high is 5.\n",
    "    -   Values at low and high are 50 and 32 and value at pivot is 32.\n",
    "- **Partition the array on the basis of pivot:** Call for partitioning which rearranges the array in such a way that pivot (32) comes to its actual position (of the sorted array). And to the left of the pivot, the array has all the elements less than it, and to the right greater than it.\n",
    "    -   In the partition function, we start from the first element and compare it with the pivot. Since 50 is greater than 32, we don’t make any change and move on to the next element 23.\n",
    "    -   Compare again with the pivot. Since 23 is less than 32, we swap 50 and 23. The array becomes `23, 50, 9, 18, 61, 32`\n",
    "    -   We move on to the next element 9 which is again less than pivot (32) thus swapping it with 50 makes our array as `23, 9, 50, 18, 61, 32`.\n",
    "    -   Similarly, for next element 18 which is less than 32, the array becomes `23, 9, 18, 50, 61, 32`. Now 61 is greater than pivot (32), hence no changes.\n",
    "    -   Lastly, we swap our pivot with 50 so that it comes to the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the pivot (32) comes at its actual position and all elements to its left are lesser, and all elements to the right are greater than itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: \n",
    "The main array after the first step becomes\n",
    "`23, 9, 18, 32, 61, 50`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: \n",
    "Now the list is divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Sublist before pivot element\n",
    "2.  Sublist after pivot element\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: Repeat the steps for the left and right sublists recursively. The final array thus becomes  \n",

The Worst-Case complexity is still _O(N2)_. Though, when the array is already sorted, the worst case is avoided, but the worst case is hit when the array contains many repeated elements. \n",

    "Consider an array arr[] = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], i.e. array has all (or many) equal elements. On partitioning this array with the single-pivot partitioning scheme, we’ll get two partitions. The first partition will be empty, while the second partition will have (N – 1) elements. Further, each subsequent invocation of the partition procedure will reduce the input size by only one. Since the partition procedure has _O(N)_ complexity, the overall time complexity will be _O(N2)_. This is the worst-case scenario when the input array has many repeated elements.\n",

    "### **Three-way Partitioning:** \n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently sort an array having a high number of repeated keys, we can place keys in the right position when we first encounter them. So three-way partitioning of the array consists of the following three partitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The left-most partition contains elements that are strictly less than the pivot.\n",
    "-   The middle partition contains all elements which are equal to the pivot.\n",

With a high number of duplicate keys, we always get the worst-case performance with the trivial implementation of Quick Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using three-way partitioning reduces the impact of numerous duplicate keys. In fact, an array with all elements sorts in _O(N2)_ time in single-pivot partitioning while it sorts in _O(N)_ (linear) time complexity in three-way partitioning. Thus, what used to be worst-case turns out to be the best-case scenario for three-way partitioning.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Bentley-McIlroy’s Optimized 3-Way Partitioning:** \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is an **iteration-based partitioning scheme**. All the elements of the array are unexplored initially. Start exploring the elements of the array from the left and right directions. After each iteration, it can be visualized that the array as a composition of five regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Extreme two ends are regions that have elements equal to the pivot value.\n",
    "-   The unexplored region stays in the center and its size keeps on shrinking with each iteration.\n",
    "-   On the left side of the unexplored region are elements lesser than the pivot value.\n",
    "-   On the right side of the unexplored region are elements greater than the pivot value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the iteration procedure continues, the unexplored region of the array keeps on decreasing, and finally, the array will have no unexplored element remaining. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since the elements equal to the pivot element is greater than elements in the Less region and less than elements in the greater region, they need to be moved to the center between the lesser and greater region. They are brought to the center by swapping with elements from lesser and greater regions.\n",
