    "## Tagging and Hashtags  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tagging is a process in which end users use free-form keywords to manually index content in an organic and distributed manner. The popularity of tagging has led some to claim that it is the primary classification scheme of the Internet. A tag can be thought of as an informative keyword. A user is very unlikely to tag an article with a word like “this” because it conveys very little information. Rather, they’ll often tag with a subject or sentiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with tagging are well-known.  Users often present idiosyncrasies, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and other irregularities when tagging. Specifically, four areas are critical to tagging. The first three areas are straightforward enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. tag misspelling;  \n",
    "2. tag heterogeneity, (that is, different tags denoting the same content, such as “Ziagen” and “abacavir sulfate,” which both refer to the same drug);  \n",
    "3. tag polysemy (i.e. identical tags that denote different meanings, such as, Apple may refer to fruit or a company. and;  \n",
    "4. semantic annotation of tags (i.e. abacavir sulfate is a drug).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An important area of research in text mining is call  “semantic enrichment” is a particularly difficult problem. Lexical resources are often used to annotate terms. For example, lexical databases such as WordNet is often used as a source of tag annotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*#hashtags*\n",
    "\n",
    "The social tagging in is done by placing a hash mark in front of a word or phrase, such as #BCSM, #Lyphoma, #BrainTumorThursday, #BreastCancer, #Infertility, #Diabetes, #lymphoedema, #RareDiseaseDay, #RareDisease, #ADHD, #Anorexia, #MultipleSclerosis. On social media sites (such as Twitter) a word or phrase preceded by a hash or pound sign (#) and used to identify messages on a specific topic. Hastags are essentially tags that in within text and annotated.  As such they are easy to extract from text. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Stop words*\n",
    "\n",
    "In text mining, [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) are words which are filtered out becuase they'll interfer with text analysis. Stop words usually refer to the most common words in a language, such as *the*, *is*, *at*, *which*, and on.   \n",

    "## Regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (or RE or regex or regexp or rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cerain characters have special meaning in regular expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "[] - A pair of brackets is used to indicate a set of characters.  \n",
    "'\\' - Either escapes special character or signals a special sequence.  \n",
    "?\t- The question mark indicates there is zero or one of the preceding   \n",
    "'*'\t- The asterisk indicates there is zero or more of the preceding element  . \n",
    "+\tThe plus sign indicates there is one or more of the preceding element.  \n",
    "'^' (Caret.) Matches the start of the string.    \n",
    "'$' Matches the end of the string.  \n",
    "{m} (Braces) Specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the regexp $[A-Za-z]+$ matches a seuqnece of at least one upper or lower case letters.  The regexp $^[ ]+A-Za-z0-9._-]+@[[A-Za-z0-9.-]+$[ ]+$ matches an e-mail pattern with starting and ending white spaces. There are many excellent books that describe regular expressions in detail.   \n",

    "\n",
    "For processing larger amounts of text, tag/word counts can be ineffecient using term-document matrices as these are typically very sparse matrices. Especially when one has a large dictionary of tags/words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For larger data we used a “frequency signature” approach to convert a [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) output to a format that we can use to calculate tag co-occurrence associations and mutual information. Frequency signatures are described in detail in Stefan Evert’s PhD dissertation “The Statistics of Word Cooccurrences Word Pairs and Collocations.”   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate tag co-occurrence associations and mutual information for two tags, A and B, we need four items of data. The co-occurrence count of A and B, the count of A but not B, the count of B but not A, and the total number of tags in a corpus. This co-occurrence frequency data for a word pair (A,B) are usually organized in a contingency table show below. The contingency table stores the observed frequencies $O_{11} … O_{22}$. The table below (adapted from Evert’s dissertation) shows an observed contingency table.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while the co-occurrence count of A and B, and the total number of tags in a corpus are efficiently and easily counted the count of A but not B, the count of B but not A are tricky and computationally expensive. The insight and advantage of frequency signatures is that they calculate the count of A but not B, the count of B but not A by just counting A and B and the co-occurrence count of A and B. That is, the count of A but not B is equal to count of A minus the co-occurrence count of A and B. Likewise, the count of B but not A is equal to count of B minus the co-occurrence count of A and B.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency signature of a tag pair (A, B) is usually written as $(f, f_1, f_2,N)$. Where $f$ is the co-occurrence count of A and B, $f_1$ is the count of A but not B, $f_2$ is the count of B but not A, and N is the total counts. Notice that the observed frequencies $O_{11}, ..., O_{22}$ can be directly calculated from the frequency signature by the equations below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* $O_{11} = f$   \n",

    "\n",
    "The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word/tag appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word/tag. It is a measure of jargon. If a word appears frequently in a document, it's important. Give the word a high score. But if a word appears in every documents, it's not specifc to a topic. Give the word a low score.  \n",

    "If with call $f(t,d)$ the raw frequency of a term in a document, i.e. the number of times that term t occurs in document d and $max(f(t,d))$ the maximum raw frequency of any term in the document, then the term frequency $tf(t,d)$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "In information theory, entropy is also a measure of the uncertainty in a random variable. Like tf–idf, entropy quantifies the expected value of the information contained in a message (or the expected value of the information of the probability distribution). Typically this is expressed in the number of ‘bits’ or ‘nats’ that are required to encode a given message. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense entropy can be used to estimate (like tf–idf) how much information is in a word or tag. Entropy can also be used to estimate the generating probability distribution for a text document or corpus. The entropy of many languages has been determined. English has 1.65 bits per word, French has 3.02 bits per word, German has 1.08 bits per word, and Spanish has 1.97 bits per word. Given the probability density function of word entropies and the average bits per word of a single tweet we could then assign probabilities that it is English, French, German, or Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy rate (or mean entropy rate) describes the limiting entropy over an entire probability distribution.  This can be thought of as the average entropy over a sufficiently long realization of a stochastic process, whereas the entropy is relevant to a single random variable at a given point in time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, ergodicity describes a random process wherein the average time for one sufficiently long realization of events is the same as the ensemble average. That is, the ensemble’s statistical properties (such as its mean or entropy) can be deduced from a single, sufficiently long sample of the process. In other words, there are long-term invariant measures that describe the asymptotic properties of the underlying probability distribution, and they can be measured by following any single reprehensive portion if followed long enough. For example, if I look at two particles in an ergodic system at any time, those particles may have very different states; but if I follow those particles long enough, they become statistically indistinguishable from one another. This means that statistical properties of the entire system can be deduced from a single sample of the process if followed for a sufficiently long time.   \n",

    "Stationarity is the property of a random process which guarantees that the aggregate statistical properties of the probability density function, such as the mean value, its moments and variance, remain the same at every point in time. A stationary process, therefore, is one whose probability distribution is the same at all times. Its statistical properties cannot necessarily be deduced from a single sample of the process. There are stochastic processes that exhibit both stationarity and ergodicity called stationary ergodic processes. These are random processes that will not change their statistical properties with time; hence, the properties, including the disorder (entropy) of the system, can be deduced from a single, sufficiently long sample realization of the process. There are weaker forms of the stationary condition in which the first- and second-order moments (that is, the mean and variance) of a stochastic process are constant but other properties of the probability density function can vary. Likewise, there are stationary stochastic processes that are not themselves ergodic but are composed of a mixture of ergodic components.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [Rényi entropies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9nyi_entropy) generalize the Shannon entropy, the Hartley entropy, the min-entropy, and the collision entropy. As such, these entropies as an ensemble are often called the Rényi entropies (or the Rényi entropy, even though this usually refers to a class of entropies). The difference between these entropies is in the respective value for each of an order parameter called alpha: the values of alpha are greater than or equal to zero but cannot equal one. The Renyi entropy ordering is related to the underlying probability distributions and allows more probable events to be weighted more heavily. As alpha approaches zero, the Rényi entropy increasingly weighs all possible events more equally, regardless of their probabilities. A higher alpha (a) weighs more probable events more heavily. The base used to calculate entropies is usually base 2 or Euler's number base e. If the base of the logarithm is 2, then the uncertainty is measured in bits. If it is the natural logarithm, then the unit is nats. \n",

Not until the social web and Twitter did musings about what a noncelebrity ate for breakfast or whether someone likes naps was widely available for public consumption.    \n",
