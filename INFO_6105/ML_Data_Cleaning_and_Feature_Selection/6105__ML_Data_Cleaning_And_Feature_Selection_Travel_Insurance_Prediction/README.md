## Background
<p>
A tour & travels company is offering travel insurance package to their customers. The new insurance package also includes covid cover. The company wants to know which customers would be interested to buy it based on their database history. The insurance was offered to some of the customers in 2019 and the given data has been extracted from the performance/sales of the package during that period. The data is provided for almost 2000 of its previous customers and we are required to build an intelligent model that can predict if the customer will be interested to buy the travel insurance package.

## Information about the Dataset
##### What is our ultimate aim with this notebook?
- Our ultimate aim is to build a machine learning model that can predict if the customer will be interested in buying the travel insurance package based on certaing parameters. Before we create a model we need to do some data cleaning, feature selection and exploratory data analysis of the kaggle dataset.

## We will try to answer the following questions --

- What are the data types? (Only numeric and categorical)

- Are there missing values?

- What are the likely distributions of the numeric variables?

- Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)? (Use at least three methods)

- Which independent variables have missing data? How much?

- Do the training and test sets have the same data?

- In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

- Which predictor variables are the most important?

- Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?

- What are the distributions of the predictor variables?

- Remove outliers and keep outliers (does if have an effect of the final predictive model)?

- Remove 1%, 5%, and 10% of your data randomly and impute the values back using at least 3 imputation methods. How well did the methods recover the missing values? That is remove some data, check the % error on residuals for numeric data and check for bias and variance of the error. For categorical data, calculate the accuracy and a confusion matrix.
