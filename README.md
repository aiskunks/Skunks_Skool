Stanford statisticians Trevor Hastie. Robert Tibshirani have an outstanding course and book on statistical learning called
_An Introduction for Statistical Learning_    

A free PDF version of the The 2nd edition of _An Introduction for Statistical Learning_ is available here https://www.dropbox.com/s/krvhmt7z8zxhl7f/ISLRv2_website.pdf?dl=0    

You can see the examples in python at <a href='https://github.com/aiskunks/Skunks_Skool/tree/main/I2SL_Statistical_Learning'>https://github.com/aiskunks/Skunks_Skool/tree/main/I2SL_Statistical_Learning</a>   

In particular start with chapters 2, 3, and 4.

Step 2 specifics.

Read or look at the videos for An Introduction for Statistical Learning chapters 2, 3 and 4.
Then,
1. Find a data set for classification and regression.
2. Build simple supervised models for classification and regression using logistic and linear regression.
3. Intepret the output and regression coeffecients.
4. Did the model do well.
5. What metrics did you use to evalaute classification and regression?





TODO - add links related to linear and logistic regression.
