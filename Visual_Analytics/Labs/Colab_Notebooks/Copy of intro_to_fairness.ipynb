The higher the number, the higher the education that individual achieved. For example, an `education_num` of `11` represents `Assoc_voc` (associate degree at a vocational school), an `education_num` of `13` represents `Bachelors`, and an `education_num` of `9` represents `HS-grad` (high school graduate).\n","*   `capital_gain`: Capital gain made by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n","*   `capital_loss`: Capital loss mabe by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n","*   `hours_per_week`: Hours worked per week.\n","\n","### Categorical Features\n","*   `workclass`: The individual's type of employer.

Examples include: `Married-civ-spouse`, `Divorced`, `Never-married`, `Separated`, `Widowed`, `Married-spouse-absent`, and `Married-AF-spouse`.\n","*   `occupation`: The occupation of the individual. Example include: `tech-support`, `Craft-repair`, `Other-service`, `Sales`, `Exec-managerial` and more.\n","*   `relationship`:  The relationship of each individual in a household. Examples include: `Wife`, `Own-child`, `Husband`, `Not-in-family`, `Other-relative`, and `Unmarried`.\n","*   `gender`:  Gender of the individual available only in binary choices: `Female` or `Male`.\n","*   `race`: `White`, `Asian-Pac-Islander`, `Amer-Indian-Eskimo`, `Black`, and `Other`. \n","*   `native_country`: Country of origin of the individual.
