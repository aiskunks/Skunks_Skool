The Perceptron (Neural units)\n","\n","The [perceptron]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers (functions that can decide\n","whether an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some\n","specific class or not). It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a\n","classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear\n","predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature\n","vector. \n","\n","The perceptron algorithm dates back to the late 1950s, and is the basis of [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).\n","\n","Definition\n","----------\n","\n","In the modern sense, the perceptron is an algorithm for learning a\n","binary classifier: a function that maps its input (a real-valued\n","[vector]) to an output value $f(x)$ (a single [binary] value):\n","\n","$$f(x) = \\begin{cases}1 & \\text{if }\\ w \\cdot x + b > 0\\\\0 & \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$$\n","\n","where is a vector of real-valued weights, $w \\cdot x$ is the [dot\n","product] $\\sum_{i=1}^m w_i x_i$, where m is the number of inputs to the\n","perceptron and is the *bias*. The bias shifts the decision boundary away\n","from the origin and does not depend on any input value.\n","\n","The value of $f(x)$ (0 or 1) is used to classify as either a positive or\n","a negative instance, in the case of a binary classification problem. If\n","is negative, then the weighted combination of inputs must produce a\n","positive value greater than $|b|$ in order to push the classifier neuron\n","over the 0 threshold. Spatially, the bias alters the position (though\n","not the orientation) of the decision boundary. The perceptron learning\n","algorithm does not terminate if the learning set is not linearly\n","separable. If the vectors are not linearly separable learning will\n","never reach a point where all vectors are classified properly. The most\n","famous example of the perceptron's inability to solve problems with\n","linearly nonseparable vectors is the Boolean exclusive-or problem. The\n","solution spaces of decision boundaries for all binary functions and\n","learning behaviors are studied in the reference.\n","\n","In the context of neural networks, a perceptron is an _artificial\n","neuron_ using the [Heaviside step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function) as the activation function.\n","The perceptron algorithm is also termed the **single-layer perceptron**,\n","to distinguish it from a multilayer perceptron, which is a misnomer\n","for a more complicated neural network. As a linear classifier, the\n","single-layer perceptron is the simplest [feedforward neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network).\n","\n","Learning algorithm\n","------------------\n","\n","Below is an example of a learning algorithm for a (single-layer)\n","perceptron. For [multilayer perceptrons], where a hidden layer exists,\n","more sophisticated algorithms such as [backpropagation] must be used.\n","Alternatively, methods such as the [delta rule] can be used if the\n","function is non-linear and differentiable, although the one below will\n","work as well.\n","\n","When multiple perceptrons are combined in an artificial neural network,\n","each output neuron operates independently of all the others; thus,\n","learning each output can be considered in isolation. ![A diagram showing a perceptron updating its linear boundary as more\n","training examples are added.](http://nikbearbrown.com/YouTube/MachineLearning/IMG/Perceptron_example.svg.png)\n","\n","### Definitions\n","\n","We first define some variables:\n","\n","-   $y = f(\\mathbf{z})$ denotes the *output* from the perceptron for an\n","    input vector $\\mathbf{z}$.\n","-   $D = \\{(\\mathbf{x}_1,d_1),\\dots,(\\mathbf{x}_s,d_s)\\}$ is the\n","    *training set* of $s$ samples, where:\n","    -   $\\mathbf{x}_j$ is the $n$-dimensional input vector.\n","    -   $d_j$ is the desired output value of the perceptron for that\n","        input.\n","\n","We show the values of the features as follows:\n","\n","-   $x_{j,i}$ is the value of the $i$th feature of the $j$th training\n","    *input vector*.\n","-   $x_{j,0} = 1$.\n","\n","To represent the weights:\n","\n","-   $w_i$ is the $i$th value in the *weight vector*, to be multiplied by\n","    the value of the $i$th input feature.\n","-   Because $x_{j,0} = 1$, the $w_0$ is effectively a bias that we use\n","    instead of the bias constant $b$.\n","\n","To show the time-dependence of $\\mathbf{w}$, we use:\n","\n","-   $w_i(t)$ is the weight $i$ at time $t$.\n","\n","Unlike other linear classification algorithms such as [logistic\n","regression], there is no need for a *learning rate* in the perceptron\n","algorithm. This is because multiplying the update by any constant simply\n","rescales the weights but never changes the sign of the prediction.\n","\n","![The appropriate weights are applied to the inputs, and the resulting\n","weighted sum passed to a function that produces the output o.](http://nikbearbrown.com/YouTube/MachineLearning/IMG/Perceptron.svg.png)\n","\n","### Steps\n","\n","1. Initialize the weights and the threshold. Weights may\n","be initialized to 0 or to a small random value. In the example below, we\n","use 0.  \n","2. For each example in our training set , perform the following\n","steps over the input $\\mathbf{x}_j$ and desired output $d_j$   \n","\n","Calculate the actual output:   \n","\n","a. $$\\begin{align}\n","y_j(t) &= f[\\mathbf{w}(t)\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_j] \\\\\n","&= f[w_0(t)x_{j,0} + w_1(t)x_{j,1} + w_2(t)x_{j,2} + \\dotsb + w_n(t)x_{j,n}]\n","\\end{align}$$\n","\n","b.

This is similar to the behavior of the linear perceptron in\n","neural networks.

In its simplest form, this function is binary—that\n","is, either the neuron is firing or not. The function looks like\n","$\\phi(v_i)=U(v_i)$, where $U$ is the Heaviside step function. In this\n","case many neurons must be used in computation beyond linear separation\n","of categories.\n","\n","A line of positive slope may be used to reflect the increase in firing\n","rate that occurs as input current increases. Such a function would be of\n","the form $\\phi(v_i)=\\mu v_i$, where $\\mu$ is the slope. This activation\n","function is linear, and therefore has the same problems as the binary\n","function. In addition, networks constructed using this model have\n","unstable convergence because neuron inputs along favored paths tend to\n","increase without bound, as this function is not normalizable.\n","\n","All problems mentioned above can be handled by using a normalizable\n","sigmoid activation function. One realistic model stays at zero until\n","input current is received, at which point the firing frequency increases\n","quickly at first, but gradually approaches an asymptote at 100% firing\n","rate. Mathematically, this looks like $\\phi(v_i)=U(v_i)\\tanh(v_i)$,\n","where the hyperbolic tangent function can be replaced by any sigmoid\n","function. This behavior is realistically reflected in the neuron, as\n","neurons cannot physically fire faster than a certain rate. This model\n","runs into problems, however, in computational networks as it is not\n","differentiable, a requirement to calculate backpropagation.\n","\n","The final model, then, that is used in multilayer perceptrons is a\n","sigmoidal activation function in the form of a hyperbolic tangent. Two\n","forms of this function are commonly used: $\\phi(v_i)=\\tanh(v_i)$ whose\n","range is normalized from -1 to 1, and $\\phi(v_i) = (1+\\exp(-v_i))^{-1}$\n","is vertically translated to normalize from 0 to 1.

When multiple layers use the identity activation\n","    function, the entire network is equivalent to a single-layer model.   \n","-   Continuously differentiable – This property is necessary for\n","    enabling gradient-based optimization methods. The binary step\n","    activation function is not differentiable at 0, and it\n","    differentiates to 0 for all other values, so gradient-based methods\n","    can make no progress with it.   \n","-   Range – When the range of the activation function is finite,\n","    gradient-based training methods tend to be more stable, because\n","    pattern presentations significantly affect only limited weights.\n","    When the range is infinite, training is generally more efficient\n","    because pattern presentations significantly affect most of the\n","    weights. In the latter case, smaller learning rates are typically\n","    necessary.   \n","-   Monotonic – When the activation function is monotonic, the error\n","    surface associated with a single-layer model is guaranteed to be\n","    convex.   \n","-   Smooth Functions with a Monotonic derivative – These have been shown\n","    to generalize better in some cases.
