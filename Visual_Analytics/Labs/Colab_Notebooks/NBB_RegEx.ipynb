The concept arose in the 1950s, when the American mathematician Stephen Kleene formalized the description of a regular language, and came into common use with the Unix text processing utilities ed, an editor, and [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) (global regular expression print), a filter.\n","\n","grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but is available today for all Unix-like systems and is built in to languages like python and Perl.\n","\n","# Regular Expressions
