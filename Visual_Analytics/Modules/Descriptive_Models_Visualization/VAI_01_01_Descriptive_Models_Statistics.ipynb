    "### This lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage-In Garbage Out (GIGO) may be the most widely used maxim in machine learning, but how does one assess the quality of data in an analysis pipeline? This lesson focuses on logging metrics related to the quality of a tabular (.csv style) dataset. Other lessons will focus on logging  metrics related other kinds of data such as image and audio data. Other lessons will focus on creating effective visualiztion of these logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A descriptive model describes a system and its relationships. For checking the quality of data this involves descriptive statistics and data visualization.  This notebook will focus on generating statistics related to data quality.  The next notebook I will focus on generating visualization related to data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics gives a brief overview of the charactieristics of dataset. We try to summarize a given dataset. It consists of two basic categories of measures: measures of central tendency and measures of variability (or spread).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook expects tabular (.csv) style data like those commonly found on [https://www.kaggle.com/](Kaggle).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use for this lab is from the [NYC Property Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "A year's worth of properties sold on the NYC real estate market.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Inspiration_   \n",
    "\n",
    "What can you discover about New York City real estate by looking at a year's worth of raw transaction records? Can you spot trends in the market, or build a model that predicts sale value in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Step 1 Look at and understand the data_  \n",
    "\n",
    "We may have many questions about these data but the first step in statistical learning is exploratory data analysis (EDA). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Excercise 1 (15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course you will need to find groups of one to three. Groups of two or three is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"Show and Tell One\" you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Find a group.  \n",
    "2)  Find a Kaggle dataset that is not \"NYC Property Sales\" or a data set that another group is using and is tabular \".csv style\" data. Post your group dataset to the #ENGR_5963 channel on the NEU AI Skunkworks slack. The datasets are \"first-come first serve.\"  Slack [https://join.slack.com/t/neuaiskunkworks/shared_invite/zt-9h3ckfg2-YR2h6xsTURhLKKRlQpxSzQ](https://join.slack.com/t/neuaiskunkworks/shared_invite/zt-9h3ckfg2-YR2h6xsTURhLKKRlQpxSzQ)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Join channel ENGR_5963   \n",
    "\n",
    "3)  Come up with a list of specific questions that one might have for a new data set. For example, \"Are there missing values?\" or \"What are the data types of each field?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties sold in New York City over a 12-month period from September 2016 to September 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:   \n",
    "\n",
    "BOROUGH: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).   \n",
    "\n",
    "BLOCK; LOT: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.    \n",
    "\n",
    "BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT and BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE: The type of building at various points in time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions for a novel data set\n",
    "- Detec Categorical Features Vs Numerical Features\n",
    "- Missing data, such as features with empty values.\n",
    "- Mean of the features\n",
    "- Median of the features\n",
    "- Standard Deviation of the features\n",
    "- Visual of the Spread of the data \n",
    "- Labels treated as features, so that your model gets to peek at the right answer during training.\n",
    "- Features with values outside the range you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries used \n",
    "- We use ``TensorFlow Data Validation(TFDV)`` to investigate and visualize the dataset. Understanding the input data is the most important step in building the data Science pipeline, as it can potentially harm model's prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input: \n",
    "The input to this notebook is a tabular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "The output are log files of statistics generated from the dataset related to its quality and visualization related to data quality."

    "### Shannon entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of using entropy as a measure of change in system state and dynamics comes both from [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) and from [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). In statistical physics, entropy is a measure of disorder and uncertainty in a random variable; the higher the entropy, the greater the disorder. In the statistical physics context, the term usually refers to [Gibbs entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)), which measures the macroscopic state of the system as defined by a distribution of atoms and molecules in a thermodynamic system. Gibbs entropy is a measure of the disorder in the arrangements of its particles. As the position of a particle becomes less predictable, the entropy increases. For a classical system (i.e., a collection of classical particles) with a discrete set of microstates, if $E_i$ is the energy of microstate $i$, and $p_i$ is the probability that it occurs during the system's fluctuations, then the entropy of the system is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = -k_\\text{B}\\,\\sum_i p_i \\ln \\,p_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $k_\\text{B}$ is a physical constant known as [Boltzmann's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant), which, like the entropy, has units of heat capacity. The logarithm is dimensionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "In information theory, entropy is also a measure of the uncertainty in a random variable. In this context, however, the term usually refers to the [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)), which quantifies the expected value of the information contained in a message (or the expected value of the information of the probability distribution). The concept was introduced by [Claude E. Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication.\" Shannon entropy establishes the limits to possible data compression and channel capacity.  That is, the entropy gives a lower bound for the efficiency of an encoding scheme (in other words, a lower bound on the possible compression of a data stream). Typically this is expressed in the number of ‘bits’ or ‘nats’ that are required to encode a given message. Given the probability of each of n events, the information required to predict an event is the distribution’s entropy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Low entropy means the system is very ordered, that is, very predictable. High entropy means the system is mixed, that is, very unpredictable; a lot of information is needed for prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Shannon entropy can explicitly be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(X) = \\sum_{i} {\\mathrm{P}(x_i)\\,\\mathrm{I}(x_i)} = -\\sum_{i} {\\mathrm{P}(x_i) \\log_b \\mathrm{P}(x_i)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where b is the base of the logarithm used. Common values of b are 2, Euler's number $e$, and 10, and the unit of entropy is shannon for b = 2, nat for b = e, and hartley for b = 10.When b = 2, the units of entropy are also commonly referred to as bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shannon entropy is by far the most common information-theoretic measure there are others. Other information-theoretic measures include: plog,Rényi entropy, Hartley entropy, collision entropy, min-entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence and the information dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shannon entropy is the Rényi entropy with an alpha of one (see appendix). The Shannon entropy is a simple estimate of the expected value of the information contained in a message. It assumes independence and identically distributed random variables, which is a simplification when applied to word counts. In this sense it is analogous to naïve Bayes, in that it is very commonly used and thought to work well in spite of violating some assumptions upon which it is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limiting value of $H_\\alpha as \\alpha \\rightarrow 1$ is the Shannon entropy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_1(X) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \\log p_i. \n",

If we are completely certain of an outcome $\\mathrm{P}(X) = 1$ or $\\mathrm{P}(X) = 0$ the Shannon entropy will be zero. If we are completely uncertain of an outcome $\\mathrm{P}(X) = 0.5$ the Shannon entropy will take its maximum value of 1.\n",

A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (e.g. where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g. for a large number of people where only one person has all the income or consumption and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be nearly one).\n",
