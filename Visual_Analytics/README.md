# Klee - Visual Analytics

A course on logging and visualizing metrics related to data and models. 

Garbage-In Garbage Out (GIGO) may be the most widely used maxim in machine learning, but how does one assess the quality of data in an analysis pipeline? How does one understand the results provided by ML models?  

Understanding data and models are crucial for machine learning. This course covers logging relevant data and visualizing it so that people can understand every step in an analysis pipeline.  

1) Analytics - logging relevant metrics for every step in an analysis pipeline.   
2) Visualiztion - the visualization, interpretation, and clear communication of the evidence provided by the analysis logs.
